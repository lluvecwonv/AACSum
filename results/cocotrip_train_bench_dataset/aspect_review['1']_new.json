The rooms are cute (a little rustic but clean and comfortable), the courtyard is beautiful and the staff went above and beyond to serve us or answer questions.",
                "itemB": "This is a very low-key facility - rooms do not have TVs, radios or even clocks - but the beds are comfortable and the showers work well. Clean hotel rooms, large tiled bathrooms, fans and air conditioning make for excellent cabana-like rooms."
