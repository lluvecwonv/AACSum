The user requests the extraction of core aspect from product reviews and the grouping of sentences by functionality.
Task Steps:
Extract Core Elements: Identify the key functions, features, or qualities from each sentence, using broad, general terms, while keeping the sentences unchanged.

Example transformations:
"The colors are very diverse" → Aspect: "Color"
"The design is modern" → Aspect: "Design"
Ensure Consistency: Use the same aspect word for similar mentions across different sentences, irrespective of the sentiment expressed.

Consistent aspects:
"Delicious taste" and "Unpleasant taste" → Aspect: "Taste"
Neutral Expression: The aspect word should remain neutral, ensuring it does not carry any inherent positive or negative connotations.

Maintain Originality: Do not alter the original phrasing or structure of the sentence; simply extract the aspect.

For example:
"The screen brightness and resolution are excellent" → Aspect: "Screen"
Avoid Domain Specifics: Focus on extracting general aspects such as "Quality," "Service," or "Price," avoiding domain-specific terminology.

Please strictly adhere to the Example's output format.!!

Remove Adjectives: While maintaining the original sentence structure, strip descriptive adjectives to distill the aspect in its most neutral form.
