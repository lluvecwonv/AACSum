Task:
Analyze the provided review data and classify the information into 'common' and 'unique' categories. After classification, provide a more detailed summary of the key common aspects. If the review data is provided in the form of multiple items, extract the main ideas and summarize them using key sentences.

Common: Extract only the facts explicitly mentioned in both files. Only list facts that are explicitly mentioned in both items. (For example: if both reviews mention "clean rooms" but differ on other details, only list "clean rooms" in the common section). Do not extract facts that exist in only one file. Sentences should be factual and avoid subjective statements, comparisons, or opinions. The 'common' section should include only truly shared information.

Content (cont): This section will contain the detailed content for each file, including the original sentences for each aspect. If there is additional information specific to only one file, leave it here. If the data is provided in list form, summarize the key points of the list and provide the full list if necessary. This 'cont' section should preserve as much of the original content as possible while capturing the details relevant to each individual review.

Summary: After classifying the sentences into 'common' and 'cont', provide a more comprehensive and detailed summary of the key common aspects and detailed content in both sections. Focus on including all key sentences corresponding to the common aspects mentioned in both files (itemA and itemB). The 'common' section should include all shared information, not just a minimal summary. Summarize the details of each review in the 'cont' section with key sentences, avoiding unnecessary repetition, while highlighting unique features. Do not repeat common information but ensure that both the 'common' and 'cont' sections effectively highlight the main features of each review. The final summary should provide more detailed insights into both the common and unique aspects of each review.

If the reviews are provided in list form, the 'common' and 'cont' sections should be summarized into sentences. The results must be output in JSON format, and lists must also be summarized in this format. If there is no information, output "".### Example Input:
