                "The hotel is not only a convenient location, but very clean and very comfortable. The staff are friendly and the breakfast delicious. Very reasonable rates and altogether a good place to stay which is situated 5 mins from the Grand Bazaar and the tram. I have been before and will stay there again without a doubt.",
                "The breakfast was excelent, very friendly and helpful staff, clean rooms, and well worth the price. I would stay here again and again.",
                "very good service, staff is very friendly and helping, pick and dropp of when you stay few days, free internet ( for me very important), near to meny historical places.",
                "Booked in Inter Hotel last August 2009 but had to cancel after a month due to work load. I just sent them an email and they returned my Deposit of 25 Euros to my credit card. Other hotels will not do that! Will definitely book again in this hotel because I read a lot of satisfied guests. I also want to experience what they experienced from staying in INTER HOTEL. Thank you guys!",
                "I have stayed in this hotel for 10 days for the second time and will definetely be back again! Apart from hotels excellent location ( it's near all sightseeing places ) the rooms were cozy and staff friendly and ready to help me with connecting my laptop to the wireless internet, to give me advice where to go and which trasport to catch. Beside fluent English and Turkish they speak all ex-Yu languages ( Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, Bosnian ) so it is very convinient for people from these countries to stay there. Room service was quick ( beverages only ) , towels changed daily and room and bathroom kept perfectly clean -spotless!!! Definetely coming back here when I come back to Istanbul for some leather jackets shopping :) and this time bringing friends as well ! Miljana Jovanovic",
                "my wife and I stayed 3 weeks there. do we need to add more..? of course you might find better somewhere but more expensive, but you will for sure find lot worst at same price The hotel is very well located , close to grand Bazaar and blue mosque but also seashore where we could go for a run the staff was very friendly and gave us on 6 floor a room with view on the Bosphorus at a attractive price so I will be back there when back to Isatnbul",
                "Excellent money/value hotel, breakfast included. Location is great just opposite of Grand Bazar in quite street, good for tourist who want to stay close to everything. If you are one of us, looking for a cheap stay, and you look for very clean and secure hotel/hostel this is a great choice. Rooms are comfortable, especially those on 6th floor. The only minus is that you have only one way transfer, if you choose airport pickup as we did, you have to pay for transfer to the airport, but fortunately this is not a big problem while they have pretty cheap taxi's there in Istanbul :-). All in all, really worth every cent. Great job guys. Greetings from Croatia.",
                "We stayed here for several nights in mid March. The rooms were clean and comfortable, free internet access in the lobby and a tasty breakfast in the morning. Great location in the old city. Right near the Grand Bazaar, and walking distance to Haggia Sophia and the Blue Mosque.The only issue we had was the cigarette smoke from the lobby constantly drifted into our room. We had to put a damp towel under the door. For 35 Euro's per night - it was well worth it."

                "Stayed for five nights, very attentive staff, very clean and well kept hotel. Breakfast buffet is outstanding....... Have good security to drive on property must pass guard house and barrier's, metal detector when accessing lobby. The worst aspect is the cost of internet for your room, about $25 a day...ouch! Location is okay not great depending on what your doing.......near river, but a good little walk and uphill coming back. Nice view of river from the lobby lounge area.",
                "The hotel is ideally located on a hillside with a 60 acre garden. The views are superb. You can see the sea from everywhere. The rooms are large and the bathrooms of a good size. The spa is very good. Many restaurants & shopping close to the hotel. Old city is only 20 minutes by taxi. The staff is very friendly. The bar is good but the coffee shop is not so good. Food in the hotel is not as per Turkish standards.",
                "Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during a business trip in Istanbul. From the outside the hotel looks a bit out of date. However, the room are spacious and refurnished. I found the staff friendly and helpful. There is a good choice of restaurants - but beware of high prices. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend to all business travellers.",
                "The hotel had a party of it's own shortly after we arrived but they chose not to warn us that we wouldn't be able to use the outdoor pool for 48 hours or that we wouldn't be able to sleep because of the considerable noise and disruption. This is not a cheap hotel and the charming staff are badly let down by the poor management. I have been staying here, on and off, for nearly twenty years and it used to be very well run.",
                "The hotel is very good located in a large garden. Although being inmidst Istanbul, you can open the window, hear birds singing, breathe fresh air and have a beautiful view into the amazing garden and onto the Bosphorus itself. Most exiting is the roof bar / restaurant from where you have an even more excellent view while receiving very good food, drinks and service. Vety advantage is that you can reach the old town with Topkapi, Blue Mosc and all other attractions by tram. Just take a walk or a quick taxi to the end point of the tram and enjoy riding over the Golden Horn on its own rail not being bothered by any of that really crazy traffic.",
                "really the place to stay in Istanbul. perfect, professional and friendly service, great breakfast buffet, beautiful position overlooking the Bosphorus. An oasis of peace in a big garden. Big, clean rooms with all amenities. Great turndown service in the evenings with even bathrobes changed. worth repeating over and over again !",
                "I had the best time . Nice room, friendly staff, . It has a great location too, . Highly recommended!!!",
                "The restaurants and the quality of the foods and services were excellent but the whole hotel and the rooms are looking tired and really need a renovation. The spa was fantastic especially the turkish hamam. The location is great with the whole bosphorus view and nearness to the favorite places."

                "Stayed for 3 nights in march and 1 night in april 2012. I stayed in the Club area of the hotel and found the lounge to be very quite and comfortable with coffee/tea and newspapers and a 'happy hour' each evening with drinks and snacks. Buffet breakfast was excellent with a wide range of choices available. Staff were very friendly. Hotel is located slightly away from the the CBD but was easily reached by MTR.",

                "On our first trip to Hong Kong we stayed here at the Metro Park Kowloon, we only had a few days so spent most of it out of hotel, but the facilities seemed very good, lost available shop/florist/bar/snacks/pool. Buffet was very well presented and had wonderful variety. Rooms well kept, clean and modern. Air conditioning worked well, sometimes a little too well in the public places such as reception/lobbies etc, bit chilly compared to the humdity outside. Interesting Hong Kong traditions such as not using floor 13...i like superstitions!",
                "Right from the check-in to check-out, the staff and their service was prompt and excellent. The staff's compliance to our special requests within the reasonable limits is very highly commendable. The rooms were adequate except in the lighting level which we have found even in highly priced hotels - our personal preference is well/brightly lit room. The amenities in the bathroom/toilet was sufficient. The buffet breakfast included in the package was a nice spread and more than adequate to start the day off. Hats off to their free shuttle service to the main points from where we could get the MTR to any place we needed to go. Overall the best hotel at the best price for the one who needs to shower and hit the bed after a full day of sightseeing/shopping.",
                "Cannot fault hotel in any way. Breakfast very good, lots of variety. Hotel shuttle bus is brilliant. First visit to Hong Kong for my 83yr old mother so we made good use of the shuttle bus. Would definitely stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",
                "The Metropark Kowloon is a good hotel with very good price-quality ratio. Make sure you get a room in the Club floor, as some of the lower levels seem to be a bit outdated. The rooms are clean, comfortable and we couldn't hear any noises at any point so it was perfect for resting. Kowloon wasn't a beautiful area of Hong Kong, going back we would stay somewhere else, particularly if you are not into shopping (and you prefer cultural and walking activities). The staff weren't overly nice but they were helpful and alerted us that we were leaving our phone behind in the room straight away, which was particularly efficient. We found the shuttle bus to Mongkok and the harbour area extremely helpful and convenient and saved us a lot of time an money. Knowing more about Hong Kong now, I would not book a hotel with a swimming pool given the weather doesn't always permit swimming or sunbaking.",
                "The staff were very helpful and the complimentary breakfasts for the period we were there were an unexpected bonus. The Internet connection wasa free as was the excellent 30 minute mini-bus service. We did not eat at the hotel except for breakfast prefering to take in the local eateries. We found that Langham Place in Mong Kok was quite good and was only a pleasant walk from the hotel although the hotel bus route took us close. The Ladies Market is in the same location as Langham Place and made for some happy bargaining. All in all, we enjoyed our stay there.",
                "Stayed at this hotel for a week and apart from the location, which was a bit disappointing, I have no real complaints about the hotel. Upon arrival the staff were very helpful and took care of our luggage whilst we went to check in, at which we were quickly dealt with. The double room we stayed in was clean and the size was comfortable. We visited the hotel's two restaurants. The food in the restaurant was excellent and varied and is worth trying. The Sip Sip bar (which had a sporty theme) offered a good variety of cocktails and provided an opportunity to catch up with Premiership football matches. One tip I would suggest is that if you ever get a taxi back to the hotel make sure you tell the driver that you want to go to the Metropark Hotel Kowloon, as there is another Metropark Hotel nearby."

My wife and I both agreed that is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in.Hotel staff could not be more helpful and the standards of cleanliness in the rooms and elsewhere was excellent.Rooms are not huge but of a very high standard.Food quality is also superb and multi-cultural.The only slight negative point was the hotel's location, in that it is in a working class area of Kowloon that is not the most pleasant area to walk around (especially late at night). The MTR (Tube) is very close and efficient and Hong Kong island is about 15 minutes away.We booked one of the Club Rooms which are high up and give an excellent view of the City. Also the Club Rooms enable 24hr access the Hotel's Club lounge which entitles you to free breakfast (which is excellent) and free snacks and drinks at any time.",

I still found it to be small for three peoples.The advertised blissful bed were no better than any other hotel bed, hence firm and not too comfy.The Hotel is O K as a 4 star Hotel with over priced buffet meals and breckfest.The buffet in the morning and dinner times are more or less the same every night and you soon get sick of what's there.I would recommand to sample the local eateria and your money will go a long way.The gym and swimming pool are very good, especially the spa facilities, you will get all the steam room and sauna with in the changing room area and also a hot tub, all in all the spa facilities make the stay a bit special.",
                "recommend Worth booking into the club floor for the daily cocktail hour,internet access and all day nibbles.Staff excellent and the spa amazing and not 'over the top' expensive.Great couples facilities for massage and treatmentsGreat shopping mall attached and centrally located to other attractions.Beware the taxi drivers who take you the extra long route to destinations",

The weather was quite mixed so direct access to the mall and cinema next door proved very useful! Slightly expensive but i'd definitely stay again.",
                "5 star hotel 2 star attitude Good Hotel to start with, but was astonished when they could not accept my visa debit card and instead wanted a credit card..!! Debit card means you have the money in bank and not taking a loan like credit card..!! Had to keep a 1000$ security deposit instead.Excellent room, good service and though staff's are not highly trained but very much co-operative. My hassle was to pay them all bills at the end of the day throughout my 7 days stay, as due to some strange reasons they were unable to believe that I do not carry a credit card, and probably wanted to make sure that I do not catch my flight back to Dubai after seven days with all bills unpaid.I have stayed in Conrad and Peninsula in HK on my earlier visits, and have never faced such a issue."

                "We had a great week in Boston staying at the Colonnade. It was very clean and comfortable and the bathroom was excellent. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite, especially Norman. If I visited Boston again, I would definately stay at the Colonnade Hotel and would recommend it to my friends.",
                "On a recent extended visit to Boston (2+ weeks), we were lucky enough to stay at the Colonnade Hotel. This hotel is head and shoulders above other area hotels! The rooms are decorated with a quiet sophistication that is very comfortable (feather pillows and comforter, wool throw blanket), and every person we encountered on the staff - from housekeeping to the front desk - was helpful, courteous, and kind. The attached restaurant, Brasserie Jo, not only has very delicious food and a charming atmosphere, but also some of the best service we have encountered anywhere. As a whole, the service in the hotel was exceptional, and we want to thank in particular the front desk staff, concierge Jerry Good, and doorman Norman Maines. This hotel is superb in every respect, we could not recommend it more highly - we would never think of staying anywhere else in Boston.",
                "I stayed at the Colonnade for four nights for a recent conference. It is immediately adjacent to numerous things: a T connection, two fair-sized shopping plazas, several restaurants, and the Hynes Convention Center. Further, the staff was super friendly and super helpful. Thanks!",
                "Let's make this simple from the very first greeting from Norman Maines the exceptional greeter/doorman/guest advocate my entre stay this was an exceptional experience. With Norman setting the standard each and every time I entered and exited it was not surprising to find the entire team above the norm and the rooms and service to match. This is one boutique that gets it and knows how imortant the selection of team mebers is.",
                "The service was outstanding from check-in to check-out. The room service was outstanding, along with the guys up front, class act. The location is so nice and very easy to move around the City. So many great places to eat around the hotel. Nice size gym on the 5th floor with several carido machines. The Colonnade made my first stay in Boston a unique one and i will be back with my family. I felt very safe at all times and i felt like i was in the center of all activity with that location.",

We also love the location--within walking distance to Back Bay and the South End--both great walking neighborhoods. And the T is right out front if you're going further afield.",
                "I stayed here for a wedding. While the wedding party was treated well, I was often treated poorly and spoken to as if I were trespassing on the property. The room was average and the shower was VERY bad. The water pressure was painful and I felt that the shower head was going to fall off. The TV was the smallest hotel TV I have ever seen. Upon checkout, the front desk left me on hold for a long time to answer a simple question. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."

The front desk staff were professional and very helpful, as were the staff in the breakfast restaurant , tea and lounge bar. The rooms were nice, updated some. There is wireless in the lobby area though there is a charge for it in the room and some services in the business center. We were able to fax at the front desk without a charge. The Whiskey Bar was not a positive experience and will not be revisited. The location was perfect for our needs and we enjoyed staying in the historic hotel. The Christmas Tea was a treat and enjoyed by all. All in all we would most likely return.",

The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the walls were paper thin and we had very noisy neighbors who didn't sleep much on Saturday night. We called security but that was not much help. The hotel did compensate us for this inconvenience with lunch in the hotel restaurant. Otherwise it was a pleasant experience and a good value",
                "In any season, this is one beautiful place. The hotel is vintage class from a time when quality mattered. The staff is professional, helpful and always available to answer questions or make you comfortable. I have stayed here more times than I can count and it has been consistently wonderful for many years. So close to the never ending beauty of Boston Common and some of the best shopping within walking distances, restaurants abound and there is a local flavor that mixes easily with a world class feel. Boston is rich in American history....be sure to immerse and educate yourself. From Paul Revere to famous seafood this place has it all. I have traveled the world, the comfort of this hotel appeals to my sense of tranquility. Tho the rooms are small, they render a feeling like going home to visit Grandmom....it's my favorite place in the world.",
                "The room is fine but they need to finish the remodel with new baths. Providing robes would be nice also (like other fine hotels). The location is good for walking tours of the Back Bay and, across the park, Beacon Hill. We also did the Freedom Trail on foot. An easy and excellent restaurant is across the street (Via Matta) but avoid ordinary Legal Seafoods unless you like boring food. We got a $220 rate (total w/tax) from 1800hotels.",
                "Although the location is great, we found the room very small, and not soundproof. There are no coffee makers.... Would not stay there again.",
                "When I found an online price for the well-known Boston Park Plaza Hotel for $149/night, I thought there must be a mistake. Or they were doing construction next door. But I never found any problems and got a wonderful rate for a fine hotel at a great location near the Boston Garden near the Arlington St. subway stop. In fact, we were upgraded for free to the Towers floor and got a huge room, access to a lounge with free breakfast and evening appetizers and to wireless internet. This was a great place to stay for a mixed business/pleasure trip to Boston. I'd have been happy even if I had to pay more for the room.",
                "All three of the south bank of elevators malfunctioned the entire four days we were there! One group of guests was stuck in elevator #3 for over an hour and a half. My wife and I got stuck between floors twice in elevators #1 and 2 two days in a row when the electronics suddenly just went dead. After fiddling with the buttons it started up again each time after about five minutes. I believe these sorts of maintenance/safety issues are unforgivable in a hotel this expensive and we will not be staying there again!",
                "The park plaza was very nice,one block from the subway, and only 15-20min to the hotel via subway. We asked the front desk for a renovated room and we recieved a king on the 8th floor. the room was small but adequate and very clean. The beds were very comfortable, and there were many channels to choose from an the tv. Room service food was not good, however the front desk promptly apologized and credited our account. Mccormicks and schmiidt was good (the cowder, and fish n' chips). What made our stay even better is that we got it for $100 dollars a night through Priceline's name your own price deal!!"

The rooms are nice, the pool is great, but the hotel's greatest asset is the staff, who really go out of their way to treat all of their guests like they are special. Even though we are definitely not one of their high-revenue customers, everyone in the hotel treated us like we were royalty. I highly recommend the Pullman Skipper.",

My view is its more like a 4* hotel, well situated in Barcelona, not too far from the 5 star establishment , the Arts Hotel. It's a functional business Hotel with all the room amenities, ( fast wi-fi in room, multi channel TV, Bath and shower, modern ( art deco) , nice roomy lobby etc. on most nights the restaurant was not open for dinner though the chef was flexible to prepare dinner for a small party per- arranged. We were not disappointed with the food. Tasty and well presented with generous portions Rooms are mid size and comfortable, but pricey ( it was GSM congress week, I guess).",

Distance to old town (picasso museum) is about 15 minutes onwards. Staff is superior: very friendly and very helpful! Fitness: fitness centre in the hotel is tiny but there is a fitness park about 2 minutes walking distance for 16eur/day which provide a good facility. Fun: we were using the jacuzzi on the roof top few times. Very cool sitting there, enjoy a glass of wine and overlooking Barcelona... I will be here again!",
                "A great hotel for a weekend break. We thought the breakfast spread was excellent. Our room with a balcony and sea view was perfect and the sea breeze was lush. Everything was in good condition - smart bathrooms and good facilities. Only gripe would be crappy pillows and not the softest linen on the beds but i suppose one can always find something to complain about (or at least i can!) The kids with the families tended to stay downstairs in the lower pool area leaving the younger set (us) to chill by the more modern pool on the roof. The location was great as it's a minute form the beach and it's a short walk or cab into town. well recommended",
                "Though one short block off the actual sand, the place has great beaches in both directions. If you don't want the beach, there's a very fine rooftop pool with views of the sea. There's also a nice cafe right beside it with good, affordable breakfast. It's not cheap, but very nice.",

Breakfast was lovely and catered for all people(very impressed). Hotel has 2 pools which were fantastic My only negatives were 1. No English tv stations 2. Mini bar was very expensive so avoid at all costs FYI - If you don't want to be ripped off with expensive meals then avoid the sea front! We paid 55 euros for 2 pasta dishes and 2 fizzy drinks!!",
                "This is a thru 5 star hotel with excellent service. I can really recommend this hotel. It has very attentive staff. I had a great room (first floor 116), quiet, spacy, clean and very nicely decorated. This hotel has 2 great pools; 1 roof top pool with bar and 1 pool on the ground level. It is situated close to the Port Olympic, the Beach and Barcelonetta. So a great location. It is a great hotel for a combined city / beach vacation."

The location is away from the city centre but by using the metro (Bogatell located around the block) you can be any where in the city in a very little time. Use the T10 card and the metro is a cheap way to travel. The reception staff are exceptional,Crisanta, Yvonne,David and the other reception staff cannot do enough to make your stay an enjoyable one. The cleaning staff also deserve recognition the rooms and public areas are immaculately clean. Breakfast in a lovely bright room caters for the most fussy of eaters the choices available are so varied you cannot fail to leave the room satisfied and content ready to start your sightseeing day.

We all said we would definately stay at this hotel when we come again. Just a warning got a taxi from the hotel to the airport which was 24 going and for some reason 43 going back.",

The area is not as pristine and smart as the rest of the city, but it is very safe to walk late at night, it appears to be an area that is not fully residential, however taxis are plentiful and bars / restaurants are within easy walking. La Sagrada Familia was the view from our window, how brilliant to wak up to that! The staff and reception were incredibly friendly, and the hotel is very smart and clean. We will definately stay here again when we visit in 2011.",
                "Me and my boyfreind stayed here for 3 nights and it was one of the comfiest sleeps ever. The bed was two double beds pushed together so it was really big! There was a complimentary mini bar, not alcoholic though and there were only a few drinks and they don't top them up either but meh! The breakfast was awesome buffet with lots of pastries, bread and cheeses:D The only things is that it's quite a walk into town. To wall to port olympic it's about 15 mins down a looong road. Then from Port Olympic it's another 15-20 mins to port vell.",
                "The staff are very nice but the place is very grubby and old fashioned. The towels are like cardboard! The area is not nice, a bit industrial..... Would not stay there again. More like a 3 star.",
                "I struggled to get accommodation for our wedding anniversary as it clashed with the Spanish Grand Prix. I found the Pere IV on one of my many trawls, so was a bit suspicious that they still had availability. What a lucky girl I am! The receptionist gave us the 'most romantic room' - a lovely 9th floor room with a terrace and a complimentary bottle of beautiful cava to help us celebrate our anniversary. The staff could not not have been more helpful and kind, willing to give advice on sights, restaurants, bars etc. Having a pool, jacuzzi and sauna was great after a days sightseeing, although the pool was a wee bit cool! The only downside was that it was a 10 min walk to get to the main tourist areas, although taxis are plentiful and fairly cheap and there is a metro station round the corner. An extremely good value for money hotel which we would definitely use again."

Definately will stay again!",

Public transportation is readily assessable and the hotel is within walking distance to most sights within the downtown loop. Would definitely stay there again.",

We were guided each time out to what was the fastest/easiest way to either bus, train or told to take a taxi by the hotel staff. We loved every minute of our stay. The ONLY snafu was the outside flags mounted to the window of the room during a really windy time around 3-4am kept banging. Everything was clean, neat and the folks were super, super nice!",
                "Hotel was very crowded, people dogs everywhere elevators were painfully slow, and the free breakfast was more like a soup kitchen, big lineups no were to sit, and I went back 3 times with no luck. so I just gave up after awhile and went out for food."

This was my kids first time seeing snow fall, so the river was a nice backdrop. Two minor drawbacks: no soda vending machines and the toilet paper seemed a little cheap for such a nice hotel. Also, if you want a refrigerator make sure you request it. Not all rooms have them. The front desk clerks were warm and friendly.",

Everything was very clean. The check-in process was very smooth, and our room was available for us even at 1 PM. Would definitely stay here again.",
                "We stayed here for one night with our two kids, as they hotel could not accommodate both nights of our stay during a recent road trip. Like just about everything else in Chicago, the prices were steep. We were expecting more for the price we paid, but found only typical accommodations. We liked the location, the friendly and helpful bellhops, the views from our room and the top floor ballroom, and in and out privileges for the parking. We missed not having a mini fridge, and felt that having only one chair in a deluxe room with two queen beds was a miss even though there was plenty of room for more comfortable seating. The valet staff was slow to bring our car at checkout. There were no others waiting, and no new arrivals, yet it took them 20 minutes to get our car to us.",
                "Stayed here in middle of June 2011. My partner was in Chicago on business and I tagged along for fun. We had both been to Chicago before. Things I really liked about the hotel: the location was amazing and the view was really nice; the bed was very comfortable; the staff was pleasant and helpful; the business center had a printer which was great for printing boarding passes. Our remote controls never really worked, and the noise level from the hallways was surprising. I found the bathroom wasn't very clean when we arrived (hairs in the bathtub, etc) and we sometimes found certain parts of our deluxe room a little unsavoury smelling. For parking, you do have in-and-out privileges, which is quite nice.",
                "Great Chicago Location. View of the river was beautiful. The rooms were huge, especially compared to other Chicago hotels. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Only negative is the wait for the 1 elevator..sometimes up to 10 minutes. As long as you plan ahead, it isn't too big of a problem. Will stay here again!",
                "Were hoping for the best since this isn't a 'brand' name but SOOO HAPPY we tried this boutique hotel. STAFF was GREAT as well as EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE! LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Celebrating friends 50th the LADIES had a fab time all around and such a GREAT view of the City! As one other reviewer stated - it would be nice to have a mini fridge but all in all THUMBS UP UP UP!",
                "Stayed here for 2 nights for the Neocon conference. The location is excellent for business or pleasure and at a price much less than other hotels nearby. Would definitely stay again."

Stunning views of the Bosphorus, sunrise and sunset from the rooftop bar area and dining room. Breakfast and dinner can also be taken in the rooftop area which has a glorious panoramic view of the City, especially after dark. Caner, our host on arrival at reception was very knowledgeble and gave good advice re places to visit, all hotel staff were very friendly. Free internet access in the reception area was an unexpected bonus. The bedroom was a little dark and not a lot of space if you have large suitcases, we were here for 7 nights, plenty to chose from at breakfast, although pretty much the same every day, lots of fruit, cheeses, breads, choice of eggs, teas and coffees etc. Overall a fantastic boutique style hotel, THANK YOU CANER, regards, Lyn & Shahbaz",

The bar on the 14th floor has great views of the Bosporus - you must go up there. Breakfast was plentiful but very busy at peak times. Gym is small but sufficient for a quick work out. The area was a bit out of the way but fine for work. Meeting rooms were good and wifi worked ! I would be happy to visit again.",

The rooms are modern with bathtubs. Istanbul is a huge city and traffic is awful so it is best to stay in a hotel near where you plan to visit. I wanted to go to a Catholic Church (St. Anthony of Padua) and it took me 40 minutes by cab.",
                "I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel has a very good location, very close to the shores of the Bosphorus, 5 minutes from Yildiz Park. The room was very competitively priced relative to other hotels that one might consider for a business trip. My room was fine, although the view of the courtyard was less than inspiring. Explains the cheap (for Istanbul) room rate. The facilities are great for a business traveller - great gym etc, quick, efficient and very friendly service. Would recommend the hotel.",
                "Nowadays, it is so rare that those in the hospitality industry aspire to go above and beyond what is expected. I was warmly greeted with such personalized attention the second I stepped outside the car. I was immediately escorted to a private check-in floor while my bags were being taken to my room. When I entered, I had a personalized message from the manager welcoming me to The Conrad, Istanbul, which just reiterated the same warm verbal welcome I received from the bellman and the staff associated who informed me of the great number of resources available to me while I was a guest of the hotel. While I had a postcard view of the Bosphorous from my room, I could further embrace that beauty and enjoy drinks, snacks, reading material and conversation with fellow guests. The Conrad, Istanbul was a breath of fresh air when it comes to the hospitality industry. My requests were handled to my satisfactions, quickly and it was flattering to know that President Obama had also stayed at the hotel in April 2009. The one and only criticism I have of the hotel and its services is the exorbitant in-room internet fees. Hopefully those either have been or will be readjusted to a more industry competitive rate.",

But, at this price and location, it's a great hotel.",

I stayed in room 342, which is in the third floor, and has two twin beds. The room was OK, but I do have to say that each bed was extremely small!!!! 68 cm wide (which is very small) I actually asked the staff if this was normal, and they said that in Amsterdam hotels it is normal. Apart from this, I would recommend the hotel, but I would make sure, before making the reservation that they book you a room with normal sized beds. Oh, also, the room rate doesn't include breakfast (which was 7 euros, more or less)",

We believe they cater for a gay market, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.",
                "Returned yesterday from a 2 night stay at the Hotel New Amsterdam with my wife and 11 year old son and have to say what a joy it was,from the initial welcoming cup of tea to the final goodbye it was a superb experience. The hotel is very centrally located just a 10 minute walk from the Central Station and next to a charming canal and although the rooms are on the small side(we had the mini-suite in the loft which had a tricky low ceiling! and generally traditional Amsterdam hotels are on the small side) they are beautifully decorated and very cosy with high quality furnishings.Just look out for the steep stairs if you have large suitcases it can be hard work! The breakfast was typically continental with cold meats,cereals and a lovely selection of bread ,fresh juice and good coffee etc.served in a smart little dining room with a tv showing BBC news. What set this place apart for me was the service from all the staff who went out of their way to help and make us feel special-we have used many hotels in the US and Europe and can honestly say this hotel is right at the top when it comes to service,nothing was too much trouble. Would not hesitate in returning to this hotel."

The staff was friendly & helpful. Internet in the room was free and worked without any problem. The restaurant downstairs, with a good choice of wine by the glass, served tasty but pricey meals. However, there are several restaurants, grocery stores and deli shops in the neighbourhood frequented by the locals. One fish shop in the mall down the street, with a long queue at lunch hour, served a variety of seafood take-outs at reasonable prices, and the herring I tried that day was probably as good as it can be. For those who are health conscious, a morning stroll/jog along the water front would definitely help to kick off the day in the right mood.",

                "Firstly the good thing about the hotel is cultural and clean, but it doesn't really feel much like a hotel, instead, a B&B. The overall service is just fair, we booked it in advance through zuji, but when we arrived, they had no record and we need to wait for an hour for checking in. In the first day out, we left the wallets inside a luggage which is locked. Of course it may be not wise to do it, but it was too late when we found 300 euro was gone when we back while everything seems fine in the appearance. Probably it was stolen by the clean-up staff... We were very disappointed with this hotel and would not recommend to travelers.",

The only problem is that the beach is not really a beach, but a 30 feet stretch of sand where they park a couple of dirty kayaks and 2 or three jet skis . The water looks dirty and it filled with seaweed. The rest of the waterfront is not for swming as there is 5 feet concrete wall drop . I even saw what I think its a grey water discharge pipe . Bottom line is that if you want a nice comfortable hotel and don't care about the private beach, this is for you . If you are looking to get wet in the blue waters of key west while in hotel grounds, look for other options. Also parking is $18 . They will not tell you . You will see it in your credit card later.",

Shuttle service to Duval was nice but would have been nicer to have been within walking distance. Shuttle back to hotel at night was full of rowdy drinkers. Received breakfast passes since I'm a Rewards member-it only included fruit/bread area--not even the usual Marriott powdered eggs--that section was $4 extra per person.",

Key West has a lot of water activities so we didnt really miss the beach!!",
                "We were all set to go and just the night before came under the weather with flu and had to cancel the booking. Normally the hotel charges $150 as a penalty but upon learning about our situation the hotel management happily agreed to waive the penalty. This was the week after Thanksgiving, so it was not as if they were heavily booked and would find last minute reservations. Very few times have I seen such a courteous hotel management."

Where we could catch some well needed sleep.

                "We had the 3 bedroom ocean view cottage. Due to the lush foliage, the ocean is only visible from the decks off the upper rooms. The rooms are spacious and well furnished. The only thing lacking is a washer/dryer and you could live there. The only reason I would not go back is the price - including the resort fee, the lowest rate available in February was just under $600 per night when booked months in advance. We enjoyed our stay, but will try to find something less expensive next time.",
                "I stayed at Parrot Key once before when it first opened and loved it, so I chose this property again when I needed a room in Key West for Fantasy Fest. The grounds look even more lush and beautiful than before. From the road it's hard to tell what paradise awaits you as you step into the property. My sister and I had a two-level suite that was fantastic. The front desk gave us all the inforamtion we needed on the events and how to get to and from Duval during this busy time. We absolutely loved it and will stay at Parrot Key again next year!",
                "We stayed two nights in June. The resort was excellent!! Staff and service was impeccable. The resort is the right mix of relaxation. We spent most of our days relaxing in the 4 beautiful pools and sitting by the outdoor bar. It is a bit of a drive away from duval street but we weren't too keen on the drunks and parties that you find there so we were quite happy to relax at the resort. We were upgraded to a two bedroom cottage and it was spectacular! I would definitely go back to the parrot key resort again!"

                "Small hotel but in an ideal location to see sights. Breakfast basic and in a very small room which filled up quickly. Take comfy walking shoes to get around and plenty of money as the pound is not very strong against Euro and it is expensive to eat in and around venice",
                "Loved that it was hidden off the beaten path in a quiet neighborhood, yet so close to everything. Our rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice to my husband and I our two sons and my parents. I thought the Hotel was charming. We all enjoyed our stay there.",
                "we had a wonderful 5 days in venice, and the hotel is really nice and well located. when we arrived they tried to put us in an attic room, which was really small and full of low beams and dark too. we eventually got a lovely room and had to pay an extra 20 euro a day for the pleasure. the breakfast is great. the trip to murano is not good, they offer free transport to the factory, and when you get there they really push you to buy very expensive glass. i would advise anybody going to murano to go on the normal boat and then you have choice, because there are several factories and thousands of shops and all much cheaper than the one we were sent to.",
                "This is a lovely hotel and despite some of the reviews saying it was difficult to find, we had no dramas at all. The staff were very friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. There are lots of places to eat near by and getting St marks takes 5 minutes.",
                "When we found this hotel on internet we couldn't even look at others. their website looks great and I was looking forward to discover if the reality raises up to the expectations. And it did. We had a room with a mezzanine, the rooms were spacious, 2 TVs (we never used them though), nice clean bathroom with bathtub, king size bed, pretty special atmosphere overall.",
                "The location was great, very close to San Marco piazza, which was an excellent place to spend an evening. The owners were friendly, the rooms were clean, and the price was good (for Venice).",
                "We stayed at this hotel in a busy September time. It was quiet and quaint and the hotel staff was very friendly. We first got taken to a room across the bridge from the main hotel (1st floor) that seemed more like a dorm room than a hotel room. We asked to be changed into the main hotel and they showed us two rooms to look at. The first one was the size of a box but the second one was great. The location is great once you get your bearings in Venice. I would stay here again. Don't get room 107 though as it is literally in the breakfast area. We were on the second floor in a corner room.",
                "My wife and I booked here during the last week in October 2006 for a total of 4 nights and were very happy, well looked after and would definitely book again. Our room was first class. The hotel was excellent value, the breakfast buffet was unlimited and varied and the service could not be bettered. The situation for a tourist could not be more convenient as it is so central and most sites can be walked to within minutes. When transport is required the Grand Canal is 5 minutes away. As the hotel has no restaurant it is necessary to eat out (no bad thing when visiting a new city) and the recommendations of the concierge can be trusted. We followed their advice and were very happy indeed. It helps to allow them to book the restaurants, as they managed to get us in at our preferred time, when we could not. Tony Brazier"

                "Upon checking in we were offered a choice of rooms and chose to stay in a corner bedroom on the top floor overlooking the Grand Canal which was awesome. The room was spacious clean and tidy with coffee/tea making facilities. The staff were extremely helpful and upon arrival gave us a map with ideas of places to visits and the best routes to take to the various sites. An excellent buffet breakfast was included. The hotel is situated opposite the Railway station with just one bridge to walk across with our luggage which was ideal. Would highly recommend this hotel",
                "The hotel is located near the railway station on the relatively peaceful side of the canal. We loved the location because we could wander the back streets and avoid the hordes of day trippers and other tourists. We also used the vaporettos to explore Lido/Murano etc If you are mainly interested in St Mark's etc the hotel may feel a little remote. The corner canal view room we had was light, airy and exceptionally well maintained. Breakfast was great. The staff were first class. Another small elevator, however it seemed very well maintained - I took the stairs anyway !!",
                "The Huddos. Paynesville. Victoria. Australia We have returned to Australia after 6 weeks travelling overseas, we stayed at some wonderful places but our favorite place was Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice. Our stay was made so memorable by the receptionist who made us so welcome and looked after all our needs, the position right on the Grand Canal and the service. We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia. The breakfast was fine and the rooms were very clean, one of our group had upgraded to a balcony room looking over the canal and l would recommend that it is well worth paying the extra for the view of all the activity that happens on the Grand Canal.",
                "We stayed in this delightful hotel for 4 nights, as an 18th birthday treat for my daughter. We had two lovely canal view rooms and the view was fascinating. The location was amazing. It was an easy walk to all of the main tourist attractions and when the feet were tired, it was central for the main water boat routes. It was extremely pleasant to sit outside in the evenings to enjoy a drink and to watch the gondoliers. I would have no hesitation at all in recommending this gem of a hotel.",
                "The Hotel Antiche lives up to all of the positive reviews that have been written abuot it. The main advantage as far as I am concerned is its location right on the Grand Canal directly opposite the Santa Lucia railway station and within 100 metres or so of the main (only!) bus station. When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations. Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice! When you witness the poor travellers who go round in circles trying to find their hotel, it is comforting to have a hotel that is located in such fine position. As for the accomodation itself, it has all been said previously.",
                "My mother and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our tour of Europe and were so impressed with this hotel. All the staff could not have been more helpful with directions, sight seeing recommendations and restaurants. We had a blue room as we felt we needed a little bit of room and preferred a view of the Grand Canal We were certainly not disappointed. After a busy day shopping and sighteeing we would arrive back to our beautiful room with a bottle of vino, open our windows to the Grand Canal and watch Venetian life pass by, it was brilliant! The twin basin bathroom with beautiful chandeliers was a little luxury also when there is two of you. After choosing this hotel from many on tripadvisor we were so relieved to find it was everything we had hoped, read and wished for. Thank you Alessandro and Gianni for a memorable stay! I hope to one day return with my husband!",
                "Fine hotel...very close to the train station which is great. Pretty far from the main tourist sights (i.e. San Marco Piazza). You can go to Murano and watch glass blowing completely free of charge through the hotel. Small hotel, small room, and small bathrooms."

                "We are a family of three adults and stayed seven nights in the hotel. All that we have to say in praise of the hotel has been well said by other reviewers. They have rightly emphasized the hotel's many winning qualities: its closeness to key Istanbul sites, the pleasures of its rooftop dining area, the unstinting help of the staff, and the reasonableness of its room costs. There are innumerable hotels in Istanbul in every price range. You cannot go wrong in choosing the Dersaadet.",
                "Dersaadet is in the old city where most of the sites are and a quick walk to all of them. The hotel is decorated in an antique style that is very quaint and charming. The bathroom is modern with excellent pressure showers. Friendly staff and breakfast on the roof is spectacular. Remember, you get 10% off if you pay for your room in cash!",
                "We stayed there for one week and loved it. Myself, my wife and one year old had an amazing room and the staff were wonderfull. They couldn't be more helpfull particularly Umit. This place is in a great location, just round the corner from the blue mosque and I can't rate it enough.",
                "The Dersaadet Hotel is an excellent hotel sitauted within walking distance of the major attractions in Sultanahmet (Old CIty). The hotel has an authentic Ottoman feel to it, the staff could not have been more helpful and all of our needs were catered for. The buffet breakfast is continental in style and served on the roof terrace which had lovely views over the Bosphorous and of the Blue Mosque. Drinks were served on the roof terrace at a reasonable price until 11pm. I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit Istanbul. I struggle to think of any negative points to mention.",
                "We stayed for 3 nights in June and then 1 night in July. The location is great, walk to all major sights in Sultanahmet (e.g. Blue Mosque, Haghia Sofia, Hippodrome...) or you can just want up the street to catch the tram if you feel a little bit tired of walking. The building is very well maintained, kept the old charm but with modern amenities (e.g. there is a lift). Rooftop is a great place to have breakfast and some snacks/drinks, with great views of the Bosphorous and the surrounding neighourbood. Front desk guys are very very helpful and polite all the time. For the first stay, the room was directly opposite the lift with a sea view, it is fairly small and comfortable; for the second stay, the room was at the corner directly above the entrance side, this room is much bigger, in much better condition, and we are treated with Turkish Delights on a silver plate,placed on the bed, very very nice. The hotel slippers are very comfortable, they will last and they are not made of paper like the cheaper ones. One last thing to comment is the inconsistency sometimes we experience in the housekeeping e.g. blanket will be taken away after a night use, one room has shoe horn and sink plug and the other doesn't have both, these are just small issues, nothing to dampen our good feeling towards this hotel that we highly recommend you to stay.",
                "Dersaadet offers complimentary airport pickup with I think a 3 night stay. Located by the Blue Mosque, it is more or less in the center of things as a short walk will get you to the key sites. Be prepared for the call to prayer though as this hotel is right next to loudspeakers for one, if not two, mosques. 5 times a day. And certainly loud enough.Great rooftop restaurant. View is terrific. Service was great. Be prepared for plenty of tauts -- especially for rugs!!!",
                "Room clean and comfortable; delightful rooftop terrace with great breakfast and views of the city and sea. Ask for a room with a sea view. Close to all the historical sites. My daughter checked in early without difficulty; they arranged airport pick-up for me. We enjoyed our stay- and I would stay here again if I wanted to stay in the old city.",
                "The Dersaadet is an excellent hotel which provides a great (and peaceful) refuge from the hectic Old Town. The service was exemplary and staff were always willing to go that extra mile. The breakfast was very pleasant and the room and other facilities were of a very good standard."

Very safe area. The owners and staff were always there to chat, they enjoyed their guests as much as we enjoyed them.",

The hotel staff provides the very best personalized service and will eagerly point out visiting options and restaurants. Lobby has public computer available for internet use.",
                "Stayed at Hotel Basileus for 7 nights in early November during our first visit to Istanbul. A fairly priced, clean, and well maintained three story property with good size rooms. No restaurant (has breakfast room with good food) or elevator, but well worth the money. Located near all the major sights in Sultanhamet. A 10 minute uphill walk to the, Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia, Basilica Cistern, a small bazaar, tramway, ATMs and money exchanges. A 15-20 minute walk to Grand Bazaar and main shopping streets. Many restaurants within a 5-20 minute walk include Seven Hills (fish restaurant with rooftop dining and outstanding views), Armada (good views of Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia, and the Bosphorus), Sokullu (warm, cozy neighborhood place), Amedros (outdoor dining, Turkish cuisine), and Cesme (a refuge across street from hotel). A 20 minute taxi ride to Chora church and Asitane restaurant (both well worth the ride) , Spice Bazaar and other sights. Staff is terrific. All speak excellent English and everyone is friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful.",

                "We visited istanbul from greece, with a couple of friends for four days. What makes this hotel really special, is the staff. They make you feel very welcome because they are very friendly, but not in a weird or uncomfortable way. We are greatfu fot their help in planning our days in the vast city of istanbul. Also the breakfast was a nice surprise, because it was plentyful in a cosy environment. Personally, I found the beds very helpful, because you could tell they were the expensive and anatomic kind that bend only around your body and not in half. resting is very important in istanbul. mark my words. Finally, it was brand new and really clean."

One of the things that really annoyed me was the use of the internet in which you had to put a down payment of $10 on a LAN line cable to connect to a port hole with unreliable service, spending at least an hour just to connect! Not only that, the rooms would always be too cold once we got back even though the key wasn't plugged into the power system.

I was in a no smoking room but the room clearly had been smoked in for a long time previously as you could still smell it. The pool is wonderful and very clean. The staff were very friendly. I didn't use the restraint but the bar on the ground floor was good with nice food. Overall a nice hotel about 2 minutes walk from raffles but needs the rooms to be modernised.",

I was extremely happy with my room. I had meals in The Brasserie because this is what my Package included. The service was prompt and the staff eager to help and also very friendly. The hotel is central and close to MRT stations at Bungis and City Hall. There is a Burger King and a 7 Eleven store nearby so this is also a bonus.",

When we arrived early in the morning we had to wait for a few hours until checkin, but were still allowed to checkin around 9am which was quite a few hours before their official time. Room aircon was quite cold and the room was quite reasonably sized and clean. Was close to all attractions, and there was a 7-11 just next door for some cheap drinks other than the mini bar. Didn't eat in any of the restaurants as other alternatives close by. Overall quite a good hotel for the money, certainly not luxurious but either was the price.",
                "This hotel was very clean, roomy and comfortable. Excellent buffet for breakfast & dinner and a la carte lunch available, all at very reasonable prices and much-needed air-conditioned comfort! 7Eleven store right next door sold bottled water at half the price in the hotel itself (a 'must' in the humidity ). Had very cheap umbrellas for the afternoon rains as well ! The only disappointment after a long flight was the fact that only two teabags were supplied- any more was charged at $1 per bag!",
                "This is the third time over the past 10 years we have stayed here, and although not particularly fancy, I think it is pretty reasonable for the money compared to most hotels, hence the above average rating because of value for money. That aside it is probably a middle of the road property. Pretty good location, and have never had any problems with the staff, cleanliness of rooms etc. Only continuing problem is the strip of marble on the floor separating the main room with the bathroom. It is quite high and is a real killer on the toes if you are not careful ! If we go back to Singapore we will stay here again as long as the Singapore Stopover continues to be a good deal."

The room is not exceptionally big compared to other suites in Singapore. One has to climb up the stairs to use the restroom which is on the upper level, where the bed is too. I guess that is the only inconvenient part. My husband and I ended up spending most of our time on the upper level as the TV is there too. The food there during tea is not really that fantastic, but they offer free flow of champange. Serivce is really good, as the staff responded really fast.",

The rooms are large enough and extremely comfortable, there is a good variety of restaurants (I seriously recommend the Jade) and great staff.",

The location is fantastic, with subway entrance 50 yards away (important in Singapore where taxis can be a nightmare) and all the key businesses down the street. Staff very helpful, but as with nearly all five star Asian hotels, they try to compensate real \"know how\" with sheer numbers. Check out can be a problem as, again infuriatingly and in common with similar standard hotels in Asia, you have to have your credit card imprint taken again. Well worth staying and you will not in better in Singapore."

I had a corporate rate, and must say it was good value for money, given the quite central location. The service was good and the hotel staff very friendly. On the negative side, the hotel is a bit outdated and lacking style. I got a room close to the elevator, which turned out to be very noisy, and got waken up in the middle of the night by people spekaing loud (isolation is really bad, and that is the main reason why i would not recommend this hotel). Also breakfast was disappointing with very limited choices and no fresh fruit apart from apples and bananas. There is a pool, which is ok, but very very small. Perhaps a better room would make me change my opinion, but still it was lacking style and personality.",

We found the staff very accomodating and the buffet breakfast and dinner meals changed all the time. The hotel was central for all our travelling. The only bad comment, we were on a non smoking floor, yet the wardrobes smelt smoky. There was a cross section of travellers. When we go back to Singapore, we would stay again as good value for the price Over 50s from Adelaide"

Skypark is a must we went up at dusk and watched the city light up - best views of Singapore. Feel very sorry for the residents of this hotel, as they swim in the pool the visitors to the skypark are continually looking through every available area. The foyer of the hotel is a bit like a first class airline checkin area but queues to check in or out - people everywhere just milling around. Foodhall downstairs is overpriced very busy and not very good - ate there twice and wished I hadn't both times. Did live in Singapore for 4 years and there are plenty of excellent hawkers around a shame this wasn't one of them. Without a doubt it is an amazing building and a must see in Singapore.",

Room was large with big bathroom and separate shower. Always busy, especially the skypark over the hotel which was wonderful",
                "Check in was efficient, and the welcome drink was a nice touch. They allowed me to check in slightly early which was great as I was travelling with a small child. Rooms are large and very nice. Loads of facilities, shopping etc in and around the complex, we spent an entire day just exploring the area (ice skating, sampan rides, skypark, infinity pool etc). Check out was also efficient. I had read a lot of bad reviews, but didn't have any negative experiences during my stay here. Absolutely recommend staying here!",
                "its one of the best hotel i have ever seen. Simply amazingly made. specially the shape massive rooms awesome food classy sky bar at the top floor from there we can see whole Singapore incredible and so polite staff and the shopping area is huge with all possible world best brands and the casino is mind boggling with all games....i wish to visit twice a year....",
                "I have read the negative reviews here and had some mixed feelings before I checked in. But I have to admit that there was nothing that was really bad. I used the laundry service and some other Concierge services and they were all satisfying. The staff was also friendly, so all-in-all very ok. The only thing is the location. Marina Bay Sands is a bit from the city and I haven't found a convenience store at the mall just next to the hotel."

Staff had to be asked for drinks and to order food - and it did seem to be an inconvenience that we wanted service. Breakfast was the standard continental or hot and nothing very exciting. Once again the staff seemed to be inconvenienced by our presence. Given the nice rooms and good location it was disappointing that the service was so slack and uninspiring.",

                "we booked to stay here through wotif.com after initially looking to rent a self catered apartment from which to explore sydney we found this to be a very good price for us to have a very comfortable room, our flight landed at 0530 the day we were checking in so i wrote to the hotel to ask how early we could check in not expecting a positive response but we got a nice reply and when we arrived after a 24hr flight from france we were given our room at 6am!!, very good..... staff very nice would reccommend here for a good base in sydney.",
                "I experianced a most enjoyable stay with a nice room the location to my business appointment was just ideal and the service in the resturant caould not be faulted. Nice and friendly. Unfortunately the sign out was very frustrating - too long.",
                "I stayed at this Hotel for 6 nights, and not sure if I would return again if in Sydney. The location is excellent and the concierge know their stuff, but sadly I think it ends there. When I checked in I was informed that I had been upgraded, but on further inspection it was the room that I had actually paid for in advance. The room itself had a balcony (for which I paid extra), but no views as such, not like it was described on their website. The Hotel was busy and I was told to check on a daily basis if I wanted to change rooms. I was hassled most mornings at breakfast, because my name did not appear on the list which it should have been. Definitely not a 5 Star Hotel..Internet charges outrageous.",
                "Restaurant very good. Problem with bathroom was resolved very quickly.",
                "We had three nights at the Swissotel Sydney On Market Street and enjoyed our stay. We had a corner room with views out across the city. Rooms are not huge but are comfortable, clean and quiet. Breakfast was included in our three-day rate and it was excellent. We also had one evening meal at the hotel. While the meal was good, the prices were a little more than we expected. Location is excellent and in walking distance of tourist attractions, shopping and underground rail. It is a quaint hotel in that the hotel is built above Myer shopping emporium and to check in means taking dropping suitcases with a porter at the small off-street entry and taking a lift to the 8th floor which opens out onto an elegant lobby and reception. Staff were courteous and help-yourself bowls of Granny Smith apples near the lifts were appreciated. Happy to recommend the hotel.",
                "we stayed for 5 nights in the swissotel sydney. It is a great hotel with a great location. Town hall station in a 5 minute walk, St James station is about 3 mins away. If there are two or more people it is probably cheaper to get a taxi from the airport. Our room was massive, modern and spotlessly clean. the only downside was having paid the hotel bill in full before our arrival, the reception proceeded to charge my credit card again. This was a major inconvience as we were at the end of our 3 week holiday and my credit card was near it's limit. The problem was eventually sorted after a few days but it prevented me from using my card during this time. Although helpful, I didn't even get an apology from the staff!"

                "My husband surprised me with a night at the Four Seasons and dinner at nearby Quay in November 2010. It was everything you'd expect from a five-star hotel - huge bed, plush robes, gorgeous toiletries and a view to die for - it just lacked the personality you'd get from a smaller boutique hotel. The wi-fi wasn't free - which surprises me in this day and age - should you not expect it from a hotel when you're paying top dollar? We didn't spend a lot of time in the room - we enjoyed everything the Sydney Harbour foreshore had to offer - drinks, dinner, walks along the promenade. It's a good place to stay in terms of location - if you're close to Circular Quay you can get anywhere you like on buses, trains, ferries and even water taxis.",

Both Amex and the Four Seasons are quilty of a \"Bait and Switch\" scam",
                "Everything was simply perfect, the staffs, the room, the location, the room (with a 52' flat screen), the mini-bar was unbelivable and not too over-priced. If I have to go again for leisure, I will defintely choose that hotel.",
                "Stayed here for few nights when we went to sydney. Location - it's good if you want to be near the rocks, but very far from china town or other pubs if you are into night life. View - we paid extra for the opera house/harbour bridge view room but it was partially blocked by nearby buildings. We could hardly see the bridge... Room - it was very tiny, no slippers. Overall it was worse than the Four Seasons I'd stayed in shanghai few years ago. Overall i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, not up to standard in comparison with other Four Seasons around the world.",
                "I recently spent 4 nights of my honeymoon at this hotel. My first impression was this is an average hotel and not up to a four seasons standard. The rooms were too small and very bland. The pool and gym were good. The best part of this hotel is the location, and i guess that is what I paid for. There are so many other great hotels in the same vicinity that are much cheaper that I would stay in the next time i went.",
                "The room was fairly small and plain, lacking the \"wow\" factor we've experienced at some other Four Seasons properties. (But it was also the least expensive Four Seasons we've stayed at). The view was fantastic --the Opera House, Circular Quay, Harbour Bridge, and Rocks District. Our room package included a buffet breakfast each morning, and it was wonderful. Highly recommended. The gym is small but adequate and was never crowded when we were there. The pool area up on the roof is pretty. The service was excellent -- unfailingly prompt and helpful."

                "I stayed at Hotel le Bellechasse during the second half of my trip to Paris in October 2009. I absolutely loved being steps away from the D'Orsay and the Seine. The Christian Lacroix designs were probably too haute couture for my tastes but the bed was comfortable, sheets were luxe, and the room was spacious enough. Loved having a bath tub but one should note that the shower head is a hand held. I had breakfast twice and both times, I was the only one dining in the breakfast room. If you plan on visiting the D'Orsay (which you should), be sure to secure your ticket at the front desk. The hotel ticket allows you to skip the line.",

We were in a 'discovery room' decked out with flock wallpaper, beautiful yellow drapes and lovely large bath. Even though the decor was dramatic, the room was very easy to relax in and had all the mod cons needed to do so. The room came with a flat screen tv, ipod dock, safe, minibar and fluffy bathrobes. All in all a prefect romantic weekend hotel. It's in a great part of town - right behind the Musee D'Orsay (and its railway station) and surrounded by many great restaurants and pattiseries.",
                "Excellent hotel for a short stay (2-4 nights). Great spot, great value for money, very stylish. Advice: If you ring them they will give you the room you want, some are a little 'too' stylish than others. The one with the pink stripes at the front of the building was excellent. Downfall: Room was a tad small, but made up for it in covenience and charm. I wouldn't let that put you off for a short stay."

The staff were very friendly and efficient and I would recommend thi hotel with its lovely views and large comfortable rooms. My room looked all the way up the canal towards the rotunda near the Stalingrad metro station and overlooked the houseboats moored in the canal basin. The tree lined avenue alongside was used by the locals to play boules and the two cafe bars nearby were ideal for a late night drink/coffee. Easy access to Paris by metro and a real feeling that you were not surrounded by tourists but were seing a genuine slice of French life. I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel although some people might not like the walk from the station at night as it is quite dark (albeit it is past the police station).",

                "This seemed a brand new hotel. Location is nice. The room has a view over the canal. By metro you is quickly in the centre of Paris. Secured parking below the hotel. There were not enough seats in the restaurant, so be ready to wait for some time during rush hour.",
                "We booked a room 2 months ago. When we arrived last saterday, they were suddenly 'overbooked'. They said the'll send us to a different hotel, they gave us a map en showed us how to walk. When we came to the other hotel, they didn't no nothing about us. The hotelstaff send us to the wrong hotel! After a whole afternoon walking around the nieghbourhood, we finally checked in at the right hotel. A waste of our afternoon, since we stayed only a view days in Paris. We are certainly not happy with the serive at the hotel, you don't treat your guest like that and only say a simple 'sorry' afterwards.",
                "Just spent one night at the Holiday Inn, and to be honest, it's the best option on that price range. Lovely setting, and the Pompidou 'Paris Plages' really suited the setting. Chilled out area by the canal with a fab place to eat opposite the entrance, that served proper French simple food. Room spotless, and although when we went to bed we could still hear music, it didn't really bother us. The breakfast was standard, and there were hot options, they were gone by the time we went down. A previous poster mentioned one of the lifts being shut off, and we experienced this, but it didn't impede our stay any - who cares about waiting an extra minute for a lift - if you're that bothered, then use the stairs! Paris can be pretty bad for accommodation of this standard, and this is a gem. The Metro is less than 5 minutes away, and it's nice to be in a part of Paris that is not touristyy at all.",
                "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend for our anniversary. The hotel was well located to experience Paris without paying the high prices. We purchased a 3 day Visite Paris pass which allowed us unlimited travel on the metro, RER, Bus etc. to visit all the main attractions. The pass also entitled us to a 20% discount on the Euro Disney tickets and the travel there and back! I highly recommend this hotel for a great weekend away.",
                "Who would have thought that a H.I. Express could be so enjoyable. The staff were extraordinary, the setting on the canal was really nice and the Metro was real close. We enjoyed our stay here prior to meeting at another hotel for a Globus tour.",
                "My wife and myself spent 5 days in this hotel from 12th May 2009 and found it to be an exceptional hotel in a lovely location just outside Paris. Our delightful room was overlooking the canal with a view of boats as they plied their way down he canal. Brilliant shower in the good size bathroom, no bath, but this not important to ourselves. Large and very comfortable bed and room had all the facilities you would expect from this hotel group including internet connection, tea and coffee etc. Very adequate breakfast served in dining room and staff were very helpful. We used the excellent public transport system, always a good way to get about Paris, and there was a very convenient Metro station close to the hotel."

There is a metro stop within a couple blocks, which easily gets you some prime shopping and restaurant areas. The staff were very helpful, recommending great restaurants and providing directions. The rooms are not large, but the very high ceilings make the rooms feel roomy. And, the lobby bar has 2 for 1 drinks every evening. We would stay here again.",

Shower pressure was good but shower itself a bit old fashioned even if well maintained. Service a bit uneven but in general very good. Good room service but a bit expensive. Bar at the lobby looks dated. I have to say that overall it does not feel like a 5 star hotel but still quite good. Recommended.",

Leave your car at home or if you drive, park it in the garage. You are in walking distance of everything. You will need to take a cab to old Montreal. So much to see and do there too.

I would reccomend this resort but I wish management would follow through with requests made.",
                "We have stayed at least three times at the Fairmont Mayakoba and all of them have proviede us with distinguished experiences. Though a little bit expensive, when in Cancun or Playa del Carmen, this hotel brings you real comfort and amazing views both of the hotel and of the coastal zone. Food is really good, but not all of the dishes served there are to be considered as real Mexican. Generally speaking, personnel is friendly and would help you very much with everything. If money is not an issue for you, do try to stay in any of the Casitas with view to the ponds. Only one major piece of advice: if your go on a honeymoon or so, avoid holiday seasons in Mexico.",
                "I stayed at the hotel for a week in April 2010 for a conference. The hotel has a beautiful property surrounded by lakes and a PGA standard Golf course. The rooms were comfortable with good views all around. The property is huge and we needed special carts to take us around to resteraunts and beach. All in all a great hotel but slightly on the pricier side.",
                "We spent 8 days at the Fairmont Mayakoba with a 3 year old and a 12 year old, and had an absolutely fantastic stay. Our suite was amazing. The pools and grounds were incredible. And the staff, the staff was was best of any Fairmont hotel that I have stayed at. We loved it! We'll be back again next year. If you can deal with driving in Mexico, I would recommend renting a car if you plan to leave the resort frequently.",
                "Fabulous Hotel! Impeccable service, fabulous rooms, amazing walking boardwalk throughout the property. From the Welcome Drink until the check-ou, everything was Amazing! Would love to go back!"

                "This is one of the best deals in Venice. The price is a little high, but well worth it. This boutique hotel is in a relatively quite spot and still only a stop or 2 from San Marco.",
                "Paying attention to every detail, this hotel was an experience of its own. The White Room on the bottom floor was spectacular, the room service was top notch, the views from all points of the hotel were nearly fantastical! Breakfast was delicious (though one staff member seemed absolutely miserable with her job) and the always stocked minibar was so refershing during the hot summer days!",
                "The decoration and design is excellent, as are the staff. The roof terrace, lounge and breakfast room have real distinction. The public areas are small. There is a simple lunch menu that they don't publicise and which you can eat in the breakfast room or roof terrace. The location is excellent and on the edge of one of the best areas of Venice and is well removed from the tourist hordes. The room was less distinct than the public areas but that is not to complaint. In many other hotels it would be excellent. It is expensive for it's size and services though, but I'm still very glad I stayed there. Don't pre book their river taxi from the airport: it is too expensive and a far more complex arrangement than simply getting a private water taxi at the airport on arrival. This is an excellent hotel.",
                "Just stop searching for the perfect hotel in Venice because this is the one. Right next to the Salute is an idyllic spot with just twelve rooms. The staff are without exception helpful and no request is too small. The breakfast is a delight and can be served wherever suits your mood and the hotel has wonderful touches throughout.. Each room is individualised and ours overlooked the canal. A minute from the vaparetto stop and close to a number of super Art Galleries . Lovely little restaurant was recommended and did not disappoint. Take the Water Taxi transfer - the only way to travel.Just ignore the tariff it is worth every penny. Enjoy.",
                "Loved this small hotel, with a great location on the Grand Canal and right next door to the Salute Church. The staff were polite and very helpful, no problems with the English language. Will never forget the Saturday night when the Salute bells were ringing followed by all the church bells around Venice. Close to San Marco Square. If you stay on the top floor be ready for a walk up the stairs to your room.",
                "We loved the Ca Maria Adele. The hotel staff and owner were so attentive. The room was incredible and so so charming. We were greeted by champagne and passion fruit within 5 minutes of walking into our hotel. The breakfast room and the meal itself were just great. All the recommendations given by the hotel staff were awesome. Would LOVE LOVE to go back...",
                "The Ca Maria Adele is ideal in every respect. It sits on a quiet little canal just behind the magnificent Chiesa di Santa Maria and not far from the Accademia. The staff was very friendly, treated its guests with real coridality and were brimming with suggestions and assistance. Breakfast was especially satisfying in a tall room that spangled with Venetian ornament. The hotel felt very personal, it was like staying at the home of a friend. Who should stay here? Couples, old or young, families, no matter the size, single folk, businessmen. I look forward to going back to Venice and when I do so staying at the Ca Maria Adele. Recommended without any reservation whatever.",
                "Good location; enough off the beaten track to be quiet and relaxing but a great short walk to Accademia and other sites. If you like exploring places on foot its ideal. If you don't, the Vaporetto is on the door step and we had no problem getting anywhere in the city and the islands using it. Hotel was our kind of place; good style mixture of contemporary blending with the traditional with a couple of quirky bits thrown in (the light sconces in the lounge!). Very friendly and helpful, low key staff. Room was well maintained, clean and pleasant. Breakfast was simple but excellent (and filling). Would definitely go back there if staying in Venice again."

                "I stayed 3 nights in Canal Grande. A gem in Venice, near Piazzale Roma where i parked my car, near a vaporetto stop, great staff, great breakfast and great room \" Accademia\". If you are looking for a hotel to stay in Venice, dont think about it...Stay in Canal Grande. Perfect!",
                "Everything is of superb quality in this hotel and you can really see the thoughts they put into each detail - from the light switch to where the sockets are placed. We went for the highest room (Casa Nova) in the hotel which has a sky window that opens up to see the sky at night, it was very romantic. Breakfast was truly a gem - the croissants are made fresh and they tasted super delicious. There are only two tables that are out on the balcony so people have to wait for the outdoor tables. They offer free water taxi rides to the glass factory on Murano island, but it was a complete waste of time. Transport organized by the hotel to the island was perfect, but the hotel didn't arrange our transportation back and we were stuff with like 10 other people in small boat which made us completely soaked on our way back. The boat did not stop back at our hotel but just dropped us off, all soaked, at St. Mark's Square. It was the worst boat ride. Avoid the hotel's free ticket to Murano at all, you can better spend your time in Venice doing something else.",
                "I love it when Tripadvisor reviews point me in the right direction. Venice was one of the stops on my honeymoon and the staff, amenities, and location of Hotel Canal Grande does not disappoint! From the check-in, Gianni welcomed us with a detailed map, suggested walking paths, and a little joke: \"call this number and we can come get you. free! if you call after 10pm, we will think you are drunk and we will come get you...for a charge.\" Here are other highlights: - free wifi - free bottle of prosecco on the house - free hotel breakfast (which you can eat on the terrace, watching the boats go by) - modern amenities which complement seamlessly with the rococco interiors - excellent service (when we couldn't find the local laundromat, they sent an employee of a *sister* hotel to check that it was open and then escort us there-- fabulous!)",
                "Convenient location to everything and easy to find. Make sure to print out directions to the hotel for your arrival. The rooms were elegant and comfortable. Nice breakfast in the morning. The staff were pleasant and very helpful. Our last night there our neighbours were noisy and vulgar, the staff did try and control the situation and more than compensated us the next day. Despite this we wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",
                "just brilliant, can't spot one error. every need is looked after a bargain of a hotel and gr8 stuff.",
                "..what the other reviewers say. Just book & enjoy, if you can. The only negative experiences from our 2 nights in the Doge room was a somewhat unpleasant and unhelpful interaction with the night clerk, and a another situation in which some other employee spent ages finding information on the vaporetti schedule that in the end were just plain wrong. Still 4/5 for service, as the rest of the staff were marvelous.",
                "Simply the best hotel we've ever stayed at! Great location, great room, great view, great breakfast. Unbelievable value. The management and staff made us feel so welcome, without a doubt we would return again. Thank you.",
                "We had originally booked our rooms at the Hotel Antiche Figure, however when we arrived at the hotel the manager told us that he had another hotel that they were attempting to fill with guests right down the street, it was another property that they owned that had recently opened up. .He told us that if we wanted to stay there instead of the Antiche Figure he would upgrade everyone's rooms. When we saw the property and the rooms, we just couldn't say no. The manager put us in four incredible rooms beautifully decorated in an antique Venetian style, yet with very modern facilities.. ie Wireless.. flat screen tv's hidden behind mirrors etc, plus the rooms had amazing views onto the canal, or the square... which was wonderfully quiet. This place is beautiful... I would highly reccomend staying here.. especially if you are American.. the service of the staff is completely up to par with American standards.. and on that matter they excel on sevice standards.."

The staff was very gracious and helpful and the serve really delicious coffee! Rick Steves (2012) certainly didn't disappoint.",
                "We would stay here again. Great location, spacious rooms, good, friendly service........ A bonus was classical music drifting up from the opera school on the level below.",
                "We spent two nights here in May, 2011 and really enjoyed it. The location is excellent, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. We were able to easily reach the principal city sights from there. Our room was large and very well appointed (and I love that 1940s style elevator to get you there!) The staff was excellent, very helpful. (I had trouble backing up some photos from my camera to a flash drive and they assisted me.) There are a number of very good restaurants nearby so you don\u2019t have to fight the tourist hordes around the Spanish Steps or the Fountain of Trevi. We\u2019ll go back when we\u2019re in Rome.",
                "This is a cozy, tucked-away retreat from the busy streets of Rome. Our room was quiet and the owner was attentive and helpful (spoke English well). The breakfast room is a warm and inviting setting with a decent variety of food. The bed was not very comfortable (although I am extremely picky) but every other part of our stay was enjoyable. We stayed at this location three nights and were able to walk comfortably to all major sights without problem. I will not rave about this hotel, but I found nothing materially wrong with it either. This is a typical 2-3 star hotel and makes up for its lack of \"grandness\" by having a fantastically helpful and friendly staff.",
                "We stayed just one night but will surely stay here when again in Rome. Large old room with great renovated bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. Staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Even packed us a take away breakfast because we had to leave early.",
                "I booked a 3 night stay at Hotel Oceania based on a recommendation from Rick Steves. The location is definately convienent as it is a short walk from the train station which is also thier main center for Rome's subway and bus systems. Internet was available in the lobby, but was not available in the room since the wireless was not working correctly. The room was clean and the hotel was nice but our overall experience was just ok.",
                "We stayed two nights at this hotel. We found the staff very friendly, and helpful. Our room was clean and of a good size. If you want to experience true italian culture, then this family is for you. The breakfast was continental, and very good and ample. If you want scrambled eggs and bacon when you are in Europe, then stay home. If you want to enjoy the culture you are in then ask this facility for recommendations for restaurants, side trips, etc., they are more than accommodating. We will definately use this hotel on our next visit.",
                "We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay in Oceania. We had a double room that was spotless and also quite spacious. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and answered any questions we had on places to visit etc. The internet access was very useful and was free. Breakfast was lovely - breads, pastries, juices and coffee. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to all the main sites and on a nice quiet street. Would love to go back!"

                "Hotel Santa Maria is a delightful, cheery & quiet place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere, Antonio (manager) is molto simpatico -- friendly and very helpful. The hotel is not a fancy place, but quite comfy enough, with a good breakfast buffet, which you can eat in the lovely courtyard full of orange trees. The colorful neighborhood is great for walking around, lots of shops & outdoor restaurants that stay open late. You can easily walk to other sites in the city, though we mostly took cabs to centro to save time.",
                "Wonderful place to stay! An intimate, cozy place--loved the orange-tree courtyard. Front desk personnel was most helpful. Cleaning/cooking staff wonderful--very clean rooms. Breakfasts very filling and tasty--the scrambled eggs and cappuccino were my favorites. Neighborhood not touristy. 15-minute walk to the Colosseum; 25 min. to St. Peter's. They arranged driver for airport pickup and dropoff. Bells of neighboring Church could be sleep-disruptive for light sleepers, but earplugs blocked the noise.",
                "I feel the hotel is slightly overrated. The setting is fine, and there are lovely orange trees in the nice court yards of the smallish complex. However the rooms are noisy with tilen floors and banging doors. The room window gives unto the open tilen pathway leading past the doors. Breakfast is ok but basic. There is free internet available amidst the breakfast tables. Staff seems a little scarce, with the couple serving breakfast later in the day cleaning the rooms. What is missing however is the loving hand. For instance all flowers are made of plastic, even the azaleas and cyclamen outside in the garden. The personal touch somehow seems missing, and that really is a pity.",
                "Accomodating people who are always pleasent. Good breakfast. A block from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto but tucked away from all bustle. We walked to the center of Rome, Campo Fiore, Janiculum, all over Trastevere. Close to #8 tram with connections to airport, Tivoli and all of Rome. Private courtyard through gated drive. A good refuge for tired feet and bodies. We would go back.",
                "I found this area of Rome to be very special and the Hotel Santa Maria was more than I had expected. I enjoyed the peace and serentity with the safety gates, beautiful breakfast which could be taken either in the eating area or courtyard and a nice wine bar with appetizers. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Personnel were outstanding to work with. The Trastevere area is near all of the major attractions and yet, it is magical to stroll through a maze of fascinating medieval streets with some of the best restaurants in Rome.",
                "Spent 4 restful nights at a lovely oasis of calm in Trastevere. Very well looked after, nothing was too much trouble. Very convenient for all parts of Rome and Vatican. Lovely that rooms opened out into open air of courtyards.",
                "We stayed here for five nights. a great base for exploring Rome; thank heavens we took a taxi - we'd never have found it by ourselves! Right in the middle of Trastevere, ideal for restaurants etc. Nice room, pity next doors plumbing is so noisy though, otherwise very peaceful. Very nice staff - would stay here again.",
                "This was a charming, albeit somewhat pricey, refuge from the overload of Rome. The employees were wonderful and the setting very peaceful. The location was also very handy, and I would definitely stay here again."
