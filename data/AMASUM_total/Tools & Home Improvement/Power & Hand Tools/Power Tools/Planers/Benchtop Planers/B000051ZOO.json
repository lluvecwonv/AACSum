        "Yes, this planer is everything that people say it is. I am already a Makita fan, but this is certainly the finest tool in my shop! SOOO easy to use! It is very accurate, fast, safe, and FUN! It doesn't handle the 1/8\" thickness so well in my experience, but everything else does very well. I have had pieces of wood with knots snap while going through this planer and still NOT have any snipe! I don't even know how that's possible but have seen it on a couple occasions. This tool is worth every dollar and I would definitely buy it again!",
        "I have used most tools you'll find in the workshop but never a planer. After researching a bit, chose the Makita for two reasons: I believe in the brand having had and been very happy with a few other Makita products in the past, and two, because it was said to be much quieter than other brands. In an nutshell, it is definitely quite and about as simple to use as one could imagine. I didn't need to read the manual and had it working perfectly within minutes. HIGHLY recommended.",
        "5 minutes to setup out of the box, connect dust collector, check unit, read safety parts of manual. I bought this to clean old cedar pickets for use in making bee hive parts. I have hundreds of 3/4\" thick by 4 inch wide 30 year old pickets. Planing to 1/2 inch thickness. Super easy, very smooth cuts. This is going to make very nice reclaimed boards. Update - Planed about 90 boards (in the last month or so) with this, cedar and pine, and they come out smooth as glass. The blades appear to still be sharp and cut smooth. I'm very happy with this planer and blade setup.",
        "I looked at a number of brands and decided on this one due to reviews, longer blade life and easy of use. I've planed pine, cedar, cypress and oak. The results at first are great as the blades are new and very sharp. As they get worn the wood isn't quite as smooth, but that's to be expected. Or, replace the blades, which I haven't done yet. My orbital sander does the rest and I'm happy with what I get out of it. For the occasional DIY'er or low volume woodworker this will be a nice tool to have around. I've done some reclaiming of wood which has been a nice benefit also.",
        "I bought this mainly because of the low noise advertisement, although I don't have another planer to compare to, the noise level is certainly acceptable from the outside of my insulated garage. I'm sure that if I decide to invest in a Byrd shelix cutter head it'd be even more quiet (please let me know if anyone has done this). The automated head clamp seems to work well since I get 0 snipe most of the time. When I do get snipe its usually because the board is too heavy and isn't well supported. The finish is super smooth.",
        "I researched every table top planer on the planet and this one came out on top. It did not disappoint. Easy to use and set up. I used on white oak and the boards came out liked they had been sanded with 300 grit sandpaper",
        "This is the second Makita planer I have owned, after 7 years of almost daily use my old one started to overheat and squeal on shutdown. I love this planer.I will get my old one repaired and keep as a backup. I have owned or used different brands and this one is by far the best.",
        "Stop, do not bother with any other planer. This will give you the least sniping of any short feed table planer out there. You can cause it to snipe if miss feeding the lumber... If you are thinking about the DeWalt 3 blade vs this 2 blade cutting life, not to worry. Running the DeWalt 735 next to the 2012NB, the 735 blades began to show grooves after 150 bdft of knotty hickory and began to get really loud. The 2012 finished the remaining cuts at 325 bdft 4 pass and still has the same blades. I replaced the 735's blades and returned it to my friend.",
        "Finally was able to find time to go though this product with a fine-toothed comb(so to say). It is extremely well designed without the plastic and rubber that other makers are using...there is actually metal in this! Operation is straight forward without a bunch of complicated steps. And the noise level, or lack of it, is amazing! You probably don't even need to wear earplugs(although I would recommend them anyway...it's your hearing)....super quiet!! I would recommend this product over any of the others on the market, any day, to anyone!!!!",
        "I bought this based on the positive reviews and glad I did. I had a trim project requiring 1/2\" thick birch. I could buy that trim but it's hard to find and expensive. Menards in my are carries rough cut birch boards and I saved a ton of money making my own trim. The knives cut so clean that little sanding is needed prior to finishing. I used to rip boards and sand the edges to remove blade marks. Now when I rip boards, I rip them 1/4\" wider and run them through this planer. Huge time saver with much better results.",
        "Outstanding. I've ran about a couple hundred board feet of hardwoods and some softwoods through this and have always been impressed by the lack of snipe, consistency of thickness, and glass smooth surface. I also use it for jointing with a sled and shims glued under the board and it has naturally excelled at that as well. I'm finally reaching a point where I'm considering replacing the blades but expect to get another 80-100 board feet before it will be necessary.",
        "Like it a lot. Powerful and accurate. Be aware of the depth stop. It can engage during portage and if you don't pay attention you can damage the unit by adjusting the head always check this first. Otherwise very nice. Shipping sucks as usual though. The unit arrived broken.",
        "This planer works great when you first get it. 4.5 stars. But I would have to give it 3 stars because the feed rollers don't last very long and cost about $200 to replace. Over the years I've owned a couple DeWalts, a couple Rigid, and this Makita. The Makita does the best job, but is probably the worst value. Best bang for the buck has been the Rigid.",
        "I've had this planer for over a year and have to say for the price and space it was well worth it. I've planed well over 100 pieces of various hardwoods and have been pleased with the overall performance. I initially had some problems with tearout on the ends of hardwoods I'd planed and later learned that simply raising the workpiece slightly as it exits the planer will prevent tearout and it worked. (Yes, I'm relatively new to the fine woodworking arena). The accuracy and flatness of the cuts have meet all of my needs from jigs to basic furniture.",
        "I bought this Makita planer because I have been very satisfied with three other Makita power tools. It would have been nice if Makita included a dust collection hood with the planer. I bought the dust collection hood too. The dust hood has a 3\" fitting which is very odd since most dust collection systems are either shop vacs or 4\" fittings. To test the planer I ran a few boards of very hard 40 year old kiln dried cherry through it... both the right way and the wrong way (against the grain). The results were very impressive; and the dust collection worked very well too. I'm very happy with this planer.",
        "I've been using this planer since June 2007 and it still performs like it did on day one. Never had a problem. Blade change is a breeze. The only other thing I do is lubricate the chain, posts, and the threaded rod for elevating the cutter head. Highly recommend.",
        "Great bench top planer! It reall packs a punch. My first task was to put some rough cut lumber of various widths with all being one inch thick. I took off a small amount each time turning the boards over to plane each side. Wow, what a nice job it did with absolutely no sniping! The machine itself is built well, and is solid in every aspect of it's construction. Follow the recommendations for planing the various types of wood and you will not have a problem. Also, the handles on the type of the machine make it really easy to transport! Priced well, solid machine, and made in Tiawan, not China!",
        "We've been trying several brands, but this Makita is simply the best for the type of work that we do -- creating furniture from re-claimed lumber. We just have to avoid the temptation to overload this small planer and use the big industrial-type for the large jobs.",
        "I use this for a variety of tasks from milling P.T. down for one piece door jambs/stops to replacement parts for cabinets. I was very pleasantly surprised by how nice the resulting finish turned out, without any extra sanding. Can't get that result from my table saw. This planer made my workday a little easier(funner?). I haven't had any noticeable problems with snipe like so many others have reported, but I haven't put large quantities of wood through it yet. Is that a result of blade wear? I'll find out and update my review.",
        "Like others have said, it is quiet for a planer, the finish after feeding your wood through is outstanding, I didn't have to adjust the feed tables, it easy to use. I didn't think I would like it much having used high end planers in my high school wood shop, but this is amazing bang for the buck.",
        "Planes and planes. Smoother finish than a big Powermatic. Save on sanding time. Don't overthink this one.",
        "I still think this is the BEST Portable Planer on the market. Yes, it is more expensive but if you want reliability and quality cuts it is worth the extra cast. The only 2 things I dont like: 1. Dust port is extra cost and the size fits no vacuum hoses on the planet. (Come on makita) Stupid Stupid Stupid. Duct tape is a hassle. 2. It has a 12\" width max. Which is fine for most but I'm finding out I needed something a little wider. Not Makitas fault. Mine! This can take all the abuse you give it and it ask's for more. Luthierman",
        "Works Great, Very Smooth Planning. Does have some snipe, but not as bad as the dewalt. I only wish it was 12.5\", instead of the 12\". Other than that, great!",
        "I purchased my first one living overseas. Moved home and bought another one. These are so solid and easy to use. Run lots of old oak beams through this and it never slows down. Great smooth cuts. It is noisy as all planners are.",
        "height adjustment is trouble-free, finish is good. As quiet as you can expect from a machine doing what this one does",
        "In my opinion this is the best one this size that you can get .",
        "Solid and well built. Smooth cuts and a pleasure to use. Chose this over the 13.5\" Dewalt; both are excellent machines, but the blades last much longer and cost a lot less on the Makita. Not to mention the included infeed/outfeed tables that save you from spending additional $. I've mounted mine on Dewalt's mobile stand which makes moving it around the shop pretty easy. Makita, why isn't the dust hood included?",
        "This planer works great right out of the box. The depth crank handle was broken but I'm sure that was during shipment. I fixed it with JB weld since I didn't want to pack it up and send it back. I bought the dust hood for it which is essential. It fits on very easily and also works well. There is no snipe with this planer that I could see. I had the same one some years back and this model has been improved since then.",
        "Amazingly fine and simple craftsmanship in the design of the planer. Is quite and a pleasure to work with. I've planed boards up to 5 feet from soft to hard wood and it was very consistent between the two. I'm very pleased with Makita 2002NB planer.",
        "I use this planer for reclaimed barnwood, mostly walnut and oak, so pretty tough wood. This planer is amazing, so powerful and quiet I actually enjoy using it. I’m not easily impressed by woodworking tools but this thing is awesome!!",
        "Planed several pieces of cherry and I'm very satisfied. The resulting surfaces were very smooth. Amazon did not have the dust collection attachment but I found it at another online dealer. In my small shop the dust collection is a must. I've never used a planer before and I'm very pleased how easy it was to use and get great results.",
        "i have about 50 solid red oak boards that i cut from an 80+ year old tree, i have almost planed every one of them and the blades are still incredibly sharp and leaving a sweet smooth surface on final pass through. the boards run from 7 feet to 12 feet in length and sometimes has a slight trouble with feeding, but it may be because a few of the rough cut boards had more of a twist in them. it turns my cupped boards into something beautiful and amazing though! i love this planer/wood chipper, lol :)",
        "Easy to adjust. Relatively quiet. Light enough that an old cripple like me can move it. Has had plenty of power for the walnut Iand hard rock maple I have put through it. I haven't had to replace blades yet, so I can't report on that.",
        "I've had one of these planers for 5 years, and have put 1000's of board feet of rough sawn lumber through it with beautiful results...better than my 20 inch spiral cutter head grizzly. I bought a second one a year ago, which also cuts nicely. Unfortunately, with very little use the motor has begun to burn out. The estimated cost to fix it from the local Makita service center was $350. Maybe it's a bum planer, but my guess is that the manufacturing switch from Japan to China has something to do with it. Amazon still lists this as a Made in Japan tool, but that's not the case.",
        "This is truly an outstanding planer. I have checked out virtually every competitor out there and this one can't be beat for the money. Very well constructed, excellent engineering design, provides good cutting quality and good control right to the end of the piece being planed. I mounted it on a generic metal planer table, but found that its mounting hole pattern did not match the table and so had to drill a new pattern in the table. Supplied mounting bolts were way too short to connect with a non-Makita table, though. Added the optional but necessary dust collector hood, which was an easy swap. All around excellent tool.",
        "I compared several planers in the 15-amp range, and based on my experience with a small Makita hand planer, I chose the 2012NB. It is great so far, but have had it less than a month. Purchased the dust collection accessory, and it works great with my shop vac. Highly recommend.",
        "Can't say enough about this plainer. Works well, powerful, nice range. One thing it is messy. Even with the chip attachment, which you must order from Makita ($27.00 , I think) other than that it does a great job.",
        "Great machine. I created a 10' desktop out of air dried oak and walnut. Cleared the rough sawn wood easily never bogged down once. The setting adjustment tool dial gauge works well allowing precise removal levels. I have use other planers and this one is quiet in comparison.",
        "In the past I have been able to use some very nice industrial planers. Now that I have my own (small) shop, this is what I can afford & fit in my space. So far the reviews I read are true, great planer with results as good as the industrial planers I have used in the past. Now my issue - Before plugging the planer in for the first time, I opened up the blade access door and found wood shavings inside. I'm worried that I was sent a used item.",
        "I've been very happy using this planer for the last 4 years but the last time I pulled it out it did something it had never done before. The boards were jerking along, actually stopping and starting. My first thought was the rollers slipping but looking with a flashlight, the rollers were actually stopping. To make a long story short, the grease on the drive chain under the left cover had stiffened up from the cold (and age?) that it was pushing itself over the roller sprocket. Very simple fix, pull the drive chain off, into a can of degreaser, once clean and dry, install and oil. Back to cutting perfect.",
        "I have been woodworking as a carpenter and as a hobby for 40 years. This planer is the best portable planer I have ever used. The Delta models are good, but the Makita is just better. Very little if any \"snipe\". Ready to use out of the box. Solid feel when using it. I would highly recommend it.",
        "This is a good planer. I have put through boards with enough chips to fill up 7 or 8 garbage cans. Blades still cut great. I have planed some hard wood, pine and pressure treated 2 x 12. Planing 2 x 12 pressure treated thin cuts are required not 1/8 deep cuts. Worked good right out of the box. If I were to design a planer this is the kind of machine I would like to end up with. Mark",
        "I rarely write amazon reviews, but after having had this planer and used this planer for over a year now I can say without question that it was worth the extra money I paid for it over some of the other big names out there. It's compact, worked great right out of the box, and the finish is so good you can nearly go straight to finishing. The blade changes are easy and while the dust collector is a separate item, it works well too. I am extremely satisfied with it and highly recommend it for anyone with a small wood shop.",
        "Sizing vintage cherry for headboard went very well. Amazing machine! Relatively little dust when hood is attached to shop vacuum .",
        "Good tool for sure. One complaint, the roller feeds are weak, spend a lot of time pulling some woods through as they are planed. Very good tool, works well, lots of power. Have used a lot, thousands of feet through it. I would buy again, bet the feeds need work.",
        "This saw works great! I was impressed in how solid this machine was. There was no assembly required, worked right out of the box! Very smooth and quite operation. I have been a huge deWalt fan, but this saw inspires me to try other Makita products.",
        "I liked the fact that you don't have to lock out the cutting depth each time you change it. You can just spin and go. Accurate, clean cutting and easy blade changes. My first set of blades seemed to dull rather quickly but once the new ones were in back to business. No snipe if you feed properly and ample power for most tasks. I knocked it down to 4 stars because the replacement blades are way too expensive. Come on now Makita!",
        "Have had a Makita router and was so very impressed with its quality. This machine shows the same level of workmanship and quality. Produces a superb, mirror-like finish. Very happy with my purchase.",
        "BEST SMALL PLANER AROUND, BOLTED RIGHT TO MY DE WALT ROLLING MITER SAW STAND.",
        "This is one fine little planer. Very quiet and smooth finish. Did a lot of research before buying it. Could not be happier with this purchase.",
        "I know there are less expensive planers on the market. But when I think of how long I will use tools, I'm willing to spend more for the added value over a lifetime. This planer provides machine shop accuracy, and leaves the work so smooth that there's no thought of touching the work with sandpaper.....and it does this time after time.",
        "I had read reviews on this planner so I purchased it! I could not believe what a fantastic job this thing does. When wood comes out of this planner, you do not even have to sand it. The wood actually shines it is so smooth!",
        "Great planer! It's surprisingly quieter than I expected. Worth the money!. Makita continues to put out quality products.",
        "This little benchtop planer leaves a very smooth finish and is a lot quieter than other small planers I have uses. The dust collector hood is a must.",
        "Simple set up, rock solid performance, and the quietest surface planer I've ever heard. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",
        "This planer, cuts well and smoothly and the infeed/outfeed heights are easy to adjust.",
        "What a buy! Much cheaper than we priced at retail tool stores. Great quality and easily portable, too!",
        "This planer is just what I wanted. Fast, self feeds just fine, and the surface is nearly perfect. I've done 500 ft sq of cedar as a warm up and it's had no problems at all. Still in love with this little guy and see nothing to complain about.",
        "This tool performed flawlessly out of the box. I bought it specifically for an upcoming job so I didn't have to make a 40 mile round trip to the company shop. It is rugged enough to travel in a work truck yet honestly portable. I highly recommend this tool over any unnamed products.",
        "Did a lot of research as this was not my first choice. glad i was talked into this one.",
        "Cuts very smooth and the way I have it setup on a Porter Cable portable Miter saw/planer stand, there is no snipe.",
        "Wow! I just finished planing 28 board feet of oak without a single snipe. The \"interlock\" technology works! Must dust collector is on the way. Can't wait to dimension more lumber. Believe the hype.",
        "Very nice planer! Have not had enough time to really use it, but I have used others in the past and so far this one out performs them all. VERY quiet and smooth operating.",
        "This planer is plenty powerful and seems to be well constructed. It is accurate and easy to use, but my only reservation is that the slight sloppiness in the alignment of the infeed and outfeed plates seems to contribute to a little more snipe than I would have liked. Not a problem once I allowed about 3 inches at the end of the piece so I could cut clear of the snipe. Not a commercial cabinet maker's machine, maybe, but pretty good for a home hobby woodworker for the price.",
        "Bought this planer for my daughter to plane rough sawn wood in her sign business. It is everything the reviews said it was and has preformed well above our expectations. On both soft and hard hardwood boards, it does an excellent job in bringing out the wood grain and smoothing out the rough face to almost a surface that eliminates sanding. Well worth the money if you have rough boards to plane.",
        "I've used this planer to plane a couple hundred board feet so far. It has worked great.",
        "No snipe, no chatter, very little tearout even going against grain. Just keepthe blades sharp",
        "This is a great little planer. I don't have room for a floor standing model and I don't care now. This thing is well made. Light enough to lift on to my work table but heavy enough to not jitter when it's cutting. All the components are solid and smooth.",
        "After reading numerous reviews and extended research I chose this planer. Overall I am very satisfied with my decision. It is an excellent planer, producing superior results. I have only one complaint and that is the dust hood sold separately has a non standard hose fitting. I have yet to find a suitable solution.",
        "We finally got to use the planer two weeks ago and we can honestly tell you it is beyond what we expected. It will not do large pieces ( which are commercial pieces anyway)but it does do amazing with everything else. I would tell anyone who wants mid sized projects to really think about this one. We can't wait to get it set up in the shop to work on more projects!!",
        "The planer worked very nicely on some mahogany slabs that I was making into shelves. There was very little snipe and I liked the fact that the noise while operating the machine was less than other planers. The machine did jam once - but that was probably due to me trying to take off too much stock on a 12\" slab. I backed off and everything was fine. Another nice feature is the weight- which is less than most planers and makes it truly portable. Blades on the two heads look like they may be a little tricky to change when the time comes. All in all I think it was a good purchase.",
        "Wow, I should have junked my old (15 years old) planer two or three years ago. This does a beautiful job. The lumber comes out so smooth it is like it had been sanded with 100 grit sandpaper. Even planning 10 foot planks leaves very little snipe.",
        "The Makita is the best I've ever used. After four years with my Grizzly having replaced almost every part, I decided to buy the Makita. I could not be more pleased. No snipe. No noise (compared to others) and simplicity of operation. It's truly amazing. Though the Makita is about $200 more than the Grizzly it's worth every penny extra. Just buy it!! You'll be so happy with it.",
        "I feel like I got a bargain at $352 including shipping. Only complaint is that occassionally I get a deeper bite (up to a 1/16\") taken out the first 3 inches of board. Can't make it go away when it happens but can usually reduce it. Happened recently on a couple 24\" 1x10s. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars;I'm really impressed with it otherwise.",
        "It actually is fairly QUIET! Its also very accurate and refined. Its Makita thru and thru. I have extensive experience with planers this one is by far the best one Ive used for refined work.",
        "I have only used my planer a about 7 times, but it has worked great. I've used it mainly on redwood (which is very soft), and it produces excellent results. My contractor had bought a Grizzly, and was very unhappy with it. He used my planer a few times while building my deck, and commented on how well it worked and wished he had bought one of them instead of the grizzly.",
        "I got this planer three weeks ago and have since planed walnut, birds eye maple, ipe. Does a nice job, very little snipe, works quickly. The only beef is the dust chute is not included, you have to buy it separtately. It is highly recommeded that you get one. Over all a very solid nice machine.",
        "After using a few planers this is the best by far! You really need the dust hood...even if not using a dust collector.",
        "I've had this planer for over a year. I have put rough cut air dried(4+ years) red oak through it. The machine is a dream to have as a hobbyist. I recommend it, so go for it. Michael",
        "I'm a very happy owner of the planer. Excellent machine! I'm not a woodworker, my main hobby is metal (machining, welding, etc.), and I know quite a bit about quality of machinery. This planer is not a heavy commercial class machine, but it works very well. Did I say I was very happy? :)",
        "I recently purchaced the Makita 2012NB planer and found it to be more than I expected. It is fairly light and easy to move around and it's operation is easy and it does a remarkable job, little or no snipe and requires very little sanding. I haven't had to change blades yet so I'm not sure if it's as easy as they say. For several years I thought Makita was just making high price junk but they definatly have once again are manufacturing quality equiptment.",
        "Great machine ! Chewed through quarter sawn white oak with no problem . Little to no snipping, very little sanding needed",
        "Arrived in one piece. Worked great out of the box. Dust collector highly recommended",
        "this planer works great not to loud and gives a great finish and it saves alot of money in the long run",
        "smooth running.... planed oak (1x4)...maple , even pvc solid....i recommend this product...not too heavy I hate reviews with word limits!!!!!",
        "I researched all of the planers on the internet and thought this one to be the best for the money. I was not dissapointed when it arrived and I began using it. It cuts smoothly with little snipe and suits me just fine. I recommend it!",
        "This is a great planer. Worked right out of the box with no issues, and easy to use. There is a bit of tear-out on highly figured wood no matter how little I remove, but this is expected for a planer at this price range, and I think with a bit of alignment it can be improved.",
        "Having researched the Makita planer along with multiple other benchtop planers I have to say the Makita lived up to its reputation. I highly recommend it.",
        "It's a solid portable planning tool that I use on all my projects. Thickness adjustment is great. The only thing I would really like is a digital thickness measurement built into it. It rips through cedar, oak, pine, 16 penny nails. Jk. I bought it based on reviews, And also the name. It really feels like a tough piece of machinery in my opinion.",
        "I purchased this planer to make a few chairs. I am planing rough cut cedar ( not the hardest of wood) to make my chairs. This tool does a fantastic job. I would recommend to a friend in a heart beat.",
        "nice machine but needs to have dust collection shroud, (and reducer/coupling to fit a dust collection system), included as part of purchase",
        "Would not buy any other one. Powerful and quite. The quietest one on the market. Should have come with the dust shield though",
        "After looking at reviews I decided to order this palner and it is everything I wanted. I'll agree though that the dust collector should be included.",
        "Best tool ever. very minimal snipe. Stop thinking about it and just buy one",
        "Easy to use, no snipe, seems to do a perfect job.",
        "EXCELLENT ... but it's a Makita. What else would you expect?",
        "a VERY NICE MACHINE FOR THE MONEY. DISAPOINTED THAT THERE WAS'NT A PARTS LIST OR INSTRUCTION MANUAL WITH THE MACHINE.WAS INPRESSED THAT THERE WAS NO SNIPE ON THE END OF THE WOOD WHEN IT EXITED THE PLANER.",
        "Nice planer. If your looking for a item like this don't even think twice about getting this one.",
        "This makita planer is a great product for the price. I have put several hundred board feet through the machine so far and no problems and amazingly hardly any snipe on the ends. Great product for a home shop or jobsite, more than pleased so far.",
        "We got this for our carpenter son for Christmas, and he has used and used it. It's a good tool."
