        "POOR. THE FIRST BOARD I PLANED HAD NICK LINES FROM BLADES. THE CHIP DEFLECTOR DID NOT FIT, I HAD TO DRILLS HOLES TO MAKE IT FIT. I WOULD LIKE A DUST COLLECTOR HOOD AS A REPLACEMENT. SO FAR, MY LAST GRIZZLY. P.J.",
        "Husband loves it and I will soon love my new shelves that will be built with the wood he's planing",
        "What a little beast. Works great in my small wood shop.",
        "Even though this was not an expensive planer it performs like one. After clearing a bunch of Cherry from my property I had it cut to 5/4 and it's been stickered and drying for four years. It was time to start making things with it. My brother in law raved about his Grizzly so I bought mine. What a good investment. I was a little concerned it only had two knives instead of three but soon found out that was not a problem at all. This machine does the job without even hesitating. It quickly has become my favorite shop tool.",
        "I have had the planer for over a year now and have used it extensively. It has always provided excellent results with no exception. The only thing that can be done to improve it would be to have some kind of dust collection attachment. I usually have a box setup at the outfeed end and it catches about 90% of the chips coming out but it would be nice not to have to worry about it. I have many grizzly machines around my shop and I have been extremely happy with every one of them. I used their customer service twice (for other machines) and they have gone beyond my expectations both times.",
        "Easy setup and very good working with this planer so far. Nice machine .",
        "This planer is heavy, accurate, portable and priced right. It does everything ''that I want\". I will recommend this planer to all that have use a small and accurate planer.",
        "Easy to set up, easy to operate. Does the job. No complains",
        "I'm going to say the same thing here as I did on the Grizzly Jointer. Very solid construction. I wanted something made of real steel like the tools back in the day. Not all flimsy plastic. I wasn't disappointed. Professional grade is tossed around a lot. This really is. Works great. Worth the price.",
        "I own the Grizzly 14\" Ultimate Bandsaw and love it. The G0505 did not have any reviews so I hesitated but decided to take the risk and order it. 5 days later it arrived. It comes 99.9% assembled and was up and running in 5 minutes. The unit does everything it should and does it well. It is solid and vibration free. I ran several test boards through from pine to Imbuya and the surface produced is very smooth and chip free, all the way to the ends of the boards. This is one well made machine that delivers.",
        "Works great and much better built than a dewalt of equal value. Great purchase for the price.",
        "works great. I bought it because of the price and it has a lot of metal on it istead of made out of a lot of plastic. and because I use my card to purchase it, I got it deliver for free. But the package, could have been better. The box was torn all up from shipping, the unit was bent. I pull the dents out. poor handling during shipping. UPS overall satisfied, with the performance of this planner. It does get the job done.",
        "Very solid piece of equipment! 20 min. start up from box to working! Well worth the price and will recommend to friends!",
        "Husband loves product... But delivery was crappy... Box was all ripped up and didn't come with a Manuel",
        "Used this for about an hour total run time over months. Worked great at first. Now the motor slows down and overheats in a minute without planing anything. Of course warranty is up. Thanks for the expensive weight I now have in my garage.",
        "You can forget about the planers from Dewalt, Delta and such. Grizzly takes power bench tools to the next level of quality and durability. Received in 3 days, easy to unpack (heavy, no plastic, all metal!) and attach the adjustment handle & chip hood. The documentation is outstanding and clear cut. I opted for the matching stand which it fits perfectly upon. The blades/knifes are a solid 1/8\". It fired up and took a odd 2x12 and after a dozen passes, had a perfect 5/4 stock piece! No vibration or snipe here at all! This a serious chunk of machinery and its price is VERY reasonable!",
        "The simplest of machinery that I did not have to spend hours putting together. She's a heavy little workhorse that plowed through some good hardwood without a single problem. I have to say ear plugs are a must because she's pretty loud, but apart from that I am thrilled with the results, little to no snipe or tear out, watch for grain direction, which you should be doing with what ever Planer you purchase...",
        "This is planer is junk and what's worse is the customer service at Grizzly. After sending it back, due to many malfunctions and finally the motor shorting out. I've been waiting 6 weeks and I'm still without a planer. Nothing they told me was true about this process. I will never buy nor recommend any Grizzly product again!!!!",
        "This is my first Planer and my first Grizzly tool. The product arrived as described, was very easy to setup and didn't have any detectable snipe. I've run a good bit through it thus far and would definitely recommend the dust hood for it. This tool is a great value.",
        "This planer turned out to be awesome right out of the box. Within a few minutes, yes, less than 5, I was up and running. I have planed yellow pine, poplar, walnut and purple heart......all with outstanding results....no snipe at all. The only thing left to evaluate is the test of time. It seems heavy duty so my expectations are high that it will serve me well for many years.",
        "12 1/2 planer I use this about every day and and its still on the same blade side and I used it on Brazilian cherry wood which is as hard as a rock, well almost and it does a great job. Have to keep it clean blow the motor out everyday but thats just mainteance. great product I would buy another from grizzly...",
        "I drove a little over an hour to the grizzly store to purchase the G0505 planer. I was very impressed with the quality of the build (all metal). After i got it home and unpacked it I plugged it in and turned it on. Immediately I noticed the motor was very loud and had a grinding sound to it, like something was loose. It turns out that the Craftsman model that I was replacing, though not a rugged, was much smoother running and produced a nicer finish. I was very disappointed in the Grizzly, I just couldn't believe that it would have such a cheap universal motor on such a well built piece of equipment.",
        "Got this and in five minutes was working away. I used it on cypress and you should see the chips fly. Did get some snipe, adjusted the feed table and it is tolerable now. For the price you can not beat it.",
        "I bought my first one 3 years ago it held up fine for a bit, then the over load switch kept kicking when I was only planning 1/32 off of pine it continued to kick on every pass or it wouldn't feed it through to the machine's credit my guys work tools pretty hard so I figured they just over did it a few times. So I bought another bad mistake it started kicking the overload the first day when I was taking it easy, Ive yet to find a good portable planer that a professinal can use everyday without down time.",
        "Wonderfull! Has met all of my needs. I was concerned as I could not find many reviews on this planer but it has been worth it so far."
