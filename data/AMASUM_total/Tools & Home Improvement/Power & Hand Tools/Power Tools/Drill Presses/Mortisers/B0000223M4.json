        "Mortisers are specialized by nature, but with this type, the utility is very limited. If your mortises are not at 90 degrees to the surface AND 90 to the side, you can’t use this machine. Want a mortise at the end grain of a board (more then 6 inches long)?Forget it. Whatever the machine does, you can do better with a router. Instead of this machine, I find myself using my router or just chisels. If you are doing production work, by all means , a mortiser can help - just get one that tilts and allows end grain mortises. This one doesn’t.",
        "This is the first and only mortiser that I've ever used. It seems to do everything it's supposed to do, and I've used it on a dozen projects so far. I can see how having a heavier unit with a longer handle might be helpful, and I wish there were an easy way to align the chisel portion of the bit so that it's perfectly square. However, a couple of test punches lets you see any adjustments that are needed. A bigger back fence with a clamping system would be great, but again I think that probably comes with the more expensive units.",
        "I did not read the entire description all the way down at the bottom of the page - this is my fault. Maybe I can help somebody else. First surprise, the machine comes with chisels - wish this would have been more clear - because I bought a set (1/4\" - 3/4\"). Second (and bad) surprise was that the chuck accepts nothing larger than the 1/4\" bit and chisel. I need to make 4 pockets that are each 4\" long x 1/2\" wide . . . going to take some time.",
        "A good machine for the price, just had to play with the tension adjustments on the column to make the head easier to raise back up. I think it is supposed to retract to the full upright position since there is a stiff spring to do that, but it still has to be manually raised with the handle. Tried lubrication and silicone spray too, but without any changes. It drills square holes, and that's what I wanted it to do. Mounted it to a piece of plywood so I could move it around if needed, then just clamped the plywood to the bench.",
        "The fence does not track parallel, resulting in slightly off-set mortises. That being said, I would not want to exchange it because it is a workhorse for my little shop. I have a set of great chisel/drill bits and value the work I can get done on everything from hard maple to fir.",
        "I won't beat the concept to death; this is a great benchtop mortiser. Fast accurate and done in a slight fraction of the time it would take me to do it by hand. The only con is that I find i need to square the chisel bit out every so often, but not enough to be a pain or actually slow things down appreciably. I don't regret this and I wish I'd purchased one sooner.",
        "Always wanted one. I love mortise and tenon joinery. This makes it a lot easier. After reading a lot of product reviews for machines under a certain price this one was 1 of 3 finalist. I picked it because a lot of the negative reviews I read I could blame on operator error and not the tool. Also the brand name and 5 year warranty helped me decide. Be sure you have the chisel squared to the fence. Practice on scrap to make sure it is square. Easily adjusted",
        "Had one I bought at a sale. Was getting a little loose. Bought this new one and love it.",
        "Exactly as described. Never boys down. My only complaint is the Piston that's supposed to spring it back into place doesn't work as well as the demo one at rockler. I absolutely love the machine and it makes mortices effortless.",
        "I don't think I can say it much better than most of the other reviewers here, but that's never stopped me before. It's a very well made product, from the mortiser itself, the very sharp chisels that come with it and the chuck key. However, the hold down does leave a bit to be desired. It doesn't give me that sense of confidence at all times as far as whether or not it'll stay put...but it has so far. Personally, other than the hold down, I love this tool! If you're drilling holes and chiseling the waste wood or routing...well if you've got the dough (and in this economy, it's an understandable consideration!), give the Jet a looksee!",
        "Wish I had bought this years ago. Well made, accurate, and easy to use.",
        "I saw some reviews say that this did not come with any bits but it does comes with a set. I have used this on one dresser so far and it worked great. Very easy to set up.",
        "Works as designed to, as with most new items once its used it will loosen up so it will move freely, I would purchase again.",
        "The 1st one came with a cracked cast iron base. Called Amazon and they quickly shipped a new unit and picked up the defective one. Unit works great.",
        "Have enjoyed learning how to use my new mortising machine. It's been great using mortise and tenon joints instead of dowels....I am currently building a cherry table desk.",
        "Very limited height, table is too small. Otherwise, it is okay. Not a lot to brag about on this one. I'd do an internet search and find a better model.",
        "This is one fine tool. I didnt think I would ever want one of these tools but I an building a baby bed so I thought I would try one out.The only thing I can say is I waited till I was in my seventies to try one.Sorry for that. Personally I dont see how one could be any better than this.I am well satisfied.",
        "I'm a new woodworker and I bought this machine, because I was afraid of messing up good work with a drill press and hand chisels. I was apprehensive over the purchase, because most benchtop mortisers seemed to draw mixed reviews. But I needn't have worried. The Jet machine arrived in perfect shape, was very easy to set up and worked exactly as I'd hoped it would. It's not perfect, positioning the workpiece square against the fence requires some care and attention to detail, but the machine still makes mortising easy and accurate. It's definately worth the money!",
        "I'm a Delta fan and read the earlier Amazon reviews on JET'smortiser. I passed over the Delta model because of these reviews. TheJET is quickly and easily set up and it runs smoothly. Very nicely designed. Adjustments are simple and quick. The hold-down should have a horizontal adjustment to prevent binding on the upstroke, but that's a minor matter...",
        "The machine showed up in good condition and the components were square and the assembly seemed to be a decent bench top machine. Two days into owning this machine with no load on the chisel the machine started to smoke. I have a call out to Jet Technical Support who think that it is the capacitor and we will see if that will fix this. The Jet Customer Support was not particularly knowledgeable about this product which made the troubleshooting an issue. Overall I think I got what I paid for and I will need to purchase a larger professional machine because the quality control on these \"prosumer\" grade tools is just so poor.",
        "The mortise machine arrived on time, as specified and has performed as expected!",
        "I've always wanted one. Good quality and does the job just fine. Just remember take you time and do not force.",
        "Rattles excessively, but it works okay after you fiddle around with it.",
        "This is not typical Jet equipment, I have a Jet table saw, lathe and band saw, they are impressive tools. I should have read the small print with the mortiser. the throat is just enough to mortise a 2X4, in hard wood the motor jams because of wood chips, the chuck is too small 5/8ths would have been a better choice and hard to access. I did keep the machine and added a spacer for wider stock. It does work better than my drill press but not much. Rich",
        "The first unit delivered had a large dent in the motor cap. Waiting for replacement.",
        "Works well and hubby loves it. Has used it for a year now and it's still going strong. He's a woodworker so if he's happy I'd recommend it to anyone who needs one.",
        "I'm a pretty loyal Amazon fan, but I won't be ordering any used power tools again. The first mortiser I received was broken off at the head (it was a Delta). This one looked okay until I got it set up and all it did was make a \"whirring\" sound. Looking at it more closely, it appeared that it had been dropped and had a significant dent on the top of the head. Think I'm going to stick with really new.",
        "Exceptional machine. It is easy to operate, and turns out great work. Very satisfied.",
        "Works Well but in order to use a 5/8 ths bit I had to order a diffewrent chuck",
        "My only complaint about this tool is that it is somewhat tedious to adjust. Once it is \"dialed in\", it works very well.",
        "Arrived in good condition and worked very good. I am very satisfied with this tool. My project right now is made from Hawaiian Koa which is very hard and dense,,,no problems .",
        "Nice machine, easy to set up and use. I didn't get the quality of mortises that I had hoped for, but I am fairly certain that was my fault and I look forward to my next project.",
        "The tool works well! I am happy with its' ease of use and set up. For a low end mortiser it works very well for the occasional user. The first one I received had a caved in top due to improper packaging. I let Amazon know, and in two days I received a new replacement, at no charge. The staff at Amazon were great - it was very easy to get a new one sent quickly and have UPS pick up the one that was damaged. Thanks, Amazon for your wonderful customer support.",
        "The perfect machine for a handyman shop repairing small to medium furniture.",
        "I received my Jet Mortiser a couple of days ago and was pleased by the easy assembly. But better yet was the quality of the power unit and the excellent chisels that were included as a free bonus. I've cut mortises in oak, cherry, pine and even pressure treated pine all with excellent results. This is a well built tool and appears to be constructed to withstand many years of heavy use. I'm glad I checked your website reviews before ordering, as I definately made the right choice in this tool."
