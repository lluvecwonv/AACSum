        "This machine looks impressive when you take it out of the box then you turn it on and watch it vibrate so bad that is shakes the stand it's bolted to that they both start walking around on the floor. i boxed it back up and sent it back i should known you wouldn't get a quality machine for $125 and should have listen to the reviews here. so I opted to buy a industrial Jet 8\" grinder for double the price i will write a review once i get it next week.",
        "The unit vibrates, the stand has to be held down. The grinding wheels are out of balance, the course wheel is the worst. Would not buy again. Company not helpful at all. They said return it to the retailer..",
        "There is definitely vibration!! It'll vibrate right off the workbench if you don't watch it. Switched the wheels and even replaced it with buffing and wire wheels, same vibration. I have it installed on a JET pedestal which is mounted to a concrete floor, which probably is a good thing to keep it from vibrating out the door. Seems like a well built grinder, until you start it, but the noise gives it away. Really surprised, I own allot of Dewalt products and they've always been really good.",
        "I am disappointed that my Dewalt grinder was sent with no generic box over it. This was a dead give away for theft. The yellow Dewalt box stood out so all drive by's can see the nice Dewalt grinder sitting on my door step from the road. With luck I was home and my security system noted me a delivery was made. Please in the future rebox items like this so somebody does not know the contents.",
        "Might be damaged in shipping or might be the product. This vibrates like nuts... to an extent that the plastic shields rattle and often become unscrewed (not matter how tight) Would love an exchange if dewalt is listening. I tried with multiple different wheel combos and it keeps happenings",
        "I read the other reviews of it wobbling, but decided to give it a shot. It wobbles horribly. How is there no QC at DeWalt? Such a cheaply made piece of junk. Don’t they turn it on to test them before shipping? I just returned it and bought a JET. The quality of a JET tool is well worth the extra money. Lesson learned.",
        "I was concerned to buy this grinder after reading the negative reviews about it vibrating. Mine has what I would consider to be a slight vibration. It has plenty of power. It takes about 5 seconds to get up to full RPM after turning on and nearly 2 minutes to stop turning after turning it off. In the uploaded video it is just sitting on the bench without be secured at all.",
        "Ordered this one for my husband, his broke down and needed another one was reluctant to order online because it would probably take a week or longer before it will get to Hawaii. To my surprise we received it 2 days later. He immediately unpacked it put it on the floor and turned it on, he was surprised how smooth it ran no vibrations and no wobble. He then mounted the grinder on his metal roller cart and assembled the guard and tool rest and started to grind the poles. Absolutely no vibrations and no wobble. I'm glad I took a change after reading all the negative reviews. I'll update if things change.",
        "Very pleased with the Dewalt Bench Grinder...Replaced an older worn out grinder that I've had and used for years. New Dewalt runs smooth, much quieter, and has faster rpms. Was a little concerned when I ordered it because of the negative reviews on vibration. I have used and own several Dewalt tools...so I took a chance and went ahead and ordered the grinder. Glad I did as I experienced no vibration and didn't even need to bolt it down to the bench! My only complaint was the assembly instructions & diagram could be a little better.",
        "This grinder worked like gangbusters the first couple years, but I am very disappointed that it's now useless. Gets extremely hot and loses all torque. Although it's 8 yrs. old now, it was used VERY little and always stored indoors. I could easily have gotten similar or better service from a Harbor Freight grinder for half the price. DeWalt is a great USA name, but this performed as just another China unit -- which it is.",
        "Grinder arrived w/ motor seized, not able to turn on even one time! Contacted Dewalt's web site and they said reply would come in 24 hours. Nothing! I will return to the good folks at Amazon for refund. There are a lot of negative reviews of this item, but I thought...how complicated could putting a wheel on an electric motor's drive shaft? Stay away from this grinder!",
        "Works fine, but just try downloading a PDF copy of the manual. After a half-hour of being shifted from one page to another, baited by \"manual\" buttons, the website demanded that I choose between version 1 or version 2. I have version 3. At that point, I gave up and scanned the print manual. What a waste of time. Yes, this is a minor issue, but if it's an example of DeWalt's overall support, I'll think twice about buying any more of its products.",
        "Solid grinder and boy does this thing spin. Machine runs very smoothly and quiet. Initially had on an inexpensive 3 leg stand which made the stand walk all over the garage floor from power of the grinder. Put on a heavy duty stand now and i couldn't be any happier. All I pretty much buy is Dewalt tools and they've never let me down and this grinder is definitely living up to its expectations..Very pleased. And machine was packaged very well and was delivered very promptly.",
        "about 1/2 of the people who review this grinder said that they had different problems out of the box but mine out of the box ws great yes there was a little vibration with the stone but nothing to write home about the instructions were a little hard to follow but I made it through one thing is watch out for the little washers and nuts there hard to keep up with I finally got a magnet and stuck them to it over all mine out of the box was great",
        "The quality could have been better. The wheels are \"playing\" 2-3mm. I hope I'l find a way to adjust their positions later. UPDATED: Still haven't tuned the wheels but can tell the vibration is significant enough to cause a kickback-alike situation. Be cautious using the product first time or two.",
        "I'm disappointed - DeWalt didn't include the toolrest mounting hardware package and instead doubled-up the eyeshield hardware. I have a ticket into serviceNet and now need to beg for parts that should have been included. Funny how a few 5 cent washers, bolts and lock-nuts really change your experience on a product when you buy brand new and just expect it to work.",
        "I would be careful using this. I installed a wire wheel on one side and because of the speed it can rip what you are trying to clean right out of your hands. Found that out the hardway. Wear safety googles or facemask and a leather welding apron. DO NOT WEAR GLOVES WHEN USING THIS... It worked fine for me, ground 1/4 steel no problem, just learn how to properly use it.",
        "This grinder is well built, was easy to assemble and mount to my workbench. Very nice tool rests and shields making it easy to see and do precision work. I quickly set the appropriate angles to sharpen all my chisels with a concave bevel and separate finish bevel. That alone paid for the grinder! And it looks to built to last! Looking forward to many years of service from this tool!",
        "The tabletop grinder is powerful and does its job right out of the box. Just be careful when you turn off the machine. The grinder stones are well balanced and the machine keeps spinning and takes at least a minute or so to come to a stop after turning it off. Make sure you assemble it per instructions (5 to 10 mins) and you are all set! Sharpens drill bits in a jiffy. We will wait and see how well it will perform in sharpening the mower blades.",
        "I was very disappointed with this product. I have many other DeWalt products and have been happy with them. This one is extremely poorly constructed. It wobbled so much, just out of the box, that it is useless to sharpen woodturning tools. Attached to my workbench it shook so bad it cannot be used with anything on the bench. Do Not Buy",
        "Just got it and mounted it to my grinder stand. I tried it out and it vibrates a little, but not enough to make any difference on anything I would do with it. I like it.",
        "After reading some reviews that said their bench grinder was off-balance, while others said it was very smooth, I waited with anticipation to see what mine would be like. And, it's very smooth with no vibration or out-of-balance shaking. I ground a bit for my big electric demolition hammer and it worked great.",
        "I decided on an 8\" grinder bc I needed the extra hp. And I chose DeWalt bc I'm a DeWalt guy. and it didn't disappoint. I tried to stop the motor by pushing a piece of flat bar as hard as into the grinding stone. But the fb just became to hot to handle. The only issue I had was it doesn't come with a light.",
        "It’s not a rolls royce but it get the job done. I haven’t had it get bogged down by anything I’ve needed it for yet. Wish it came with a wire wheel but they aren’t expensive to buy after the fact. The attachment pieces are cheap and in no way finished. Luckily, you have a grinder to touch them up before you install them.",
        "Seems DeWalt has taken a hit in the quality control dept. I have some of their older tools that are markedly different from the build quality of their newer tools. Typical import quality here, nothing more than you'd find at Freight by the Bay. The mounting scheme for the tool rests is comical. The rests themselves are far from square. One of the rests on mine required grinding to even fit the width of the wheel. All the metal and plastic parts are thinner and softer than DeWalt tools of old. Mounting holes in the base don't line up. Mounting holes in the guards don't line up. Paying more for Yellow plastic I guess.",
        "Set it up bolting it to very heavy work bench. When I turned it on out of the box it vibrates the heck out of everything. I expected more from DeWalt.",
        "This grinder runs smooth as silk. I have no idea why other reviewers say it \"shakes\" and vibrates. Right out of the box this grinder ran perfectly. Powerful, smooth and is heavy duty. Highly recommend.",
        "Was skeptical when purchased relative to power and torque however, after using it, and comparing it to an old model I am very pleased. This is not an industrial grinder but for general purpose home and farm use it GREAT!",
        "I read some reviews saying it wobbled and vibrated, so I made sure to start it up right a way to test it out, making returning it a snap. Mine ran nice and smooth. I am a satisfied customer. Hopefully it lasts longer than the Delta bench grinder it is replacing did.",
        "Heavy duty with plenty of power for frequent shop use. The stones are fairly well balanced on the one I purchased but they do vibrate slightly. This is the second one I purchased. I used an almost identical Dewalt grinder for about 8 years with a stone and wire wheel. The old one vibrated a lot more which probably contributed to it's demise. It failed due to a broken winding. I opened it up and it Looks like the vibration was causing it to hit the housing occasionally.",
        "Got 3 of these so far... 2 6\" ones and 1 8\" one. None have been true. All wobbled. Some worse than others. The paint is also a weird color and doesn't look like a legit Dewalt product. Starting to wonder if these are knock offs, but I had the same luck at Farm and Fleet with the issue.",
        "I'm delighted with my Amazon experience! The first grinder arrived with a bad vibration. I arrived at the cause and filed a complaint.... The people at Amazon sent me a new one in two days and I'm delighted with the system. A real person on the phone that was courteous and helpful! Thank you!",
        "I had a cheap Craftsmen grinder and was looking to upgrade. I was dubious that the DEWALT tool would be a major upgrade, but boy was I wrong. This is a professional grade tool and well outperformed my expectations.",
        "This unit replaced a 20 year old grinder. I was happy with the features, price and manufacturer of this unit. My concern was the negative reviews regarding vibration. I tried it out and it works wonderfully. There is a soft, smooth hum with no vibration issues at all. It is so much smoother and quieter than the unit I replaced. Totally satisfied.",
        "This unit right out of the box vibrates so much it rattles the cabinets of my work bench. I contacted DeWalt support and after removing the medium grit (left) wheel, the vibration subsided. DeWalt is sending a new wheel. We'll see how that goes and I will update this after I have more info. 3 Stars until then.",
        "Works great seems to be well built. Went a discount freight tool store and got a nice stand for it. Works great for sharpening mower blades. Great addition to my garage",
        "I'm comparing this older underpowered Chinese no-name brands. It has a moderate vibration that does not seem to hone out, probably the somewhat inexpensive grinding wheels, but much better than cheaper brands. Works for my shop just fine.",
        "Unit looked like the real deal and then no the power switch is going bad. Horrible customer service form the seller. Screw this garbage buy elsewhere.",
        "I have to purchase new wheels and balancing system to fix this",
        "Despite the critical reviews I ordered one. After I took it out of the box I set it up and turned it on. It ran perfectly. The two grinding wheels did not wobble and the surface did not move in and out. I have a Grizzly 8 inch industrial, that cost many times what I paid for the Dewalt, that just hums when it is running-no vibration. The Dewalt is not that good but it is close.",
        "This grinder works great after I replaced a crooked wheel right from the beginning. Buying Dewalt, you expect quality all the way around. Not that it matters but the casting on the bottom is horrible. Very low QC",
        "Happy with grinder except I failed to notice it does not come with work lights above the grinding spaces. I have to rig up better lighting in my shop now. Not the product's fault, mine for not noticing when I ordered.",
        "Looks solidly made. Several small parts required for assembly were not present. Assembly instructions lack clarity. I wish speed could be adjusted!",
        "Bought this grinder after purchasing (and returning) an 8\" Harbor Freight grinder. Very little vibration with the Dewalt and only during transition from ON to full speed. The Chinese HF unit practically vibrated off my workbench. I guess all Chinese products are not created equal but you pay for it. Dewalt was 3 times the price.",
        "After reading some of the reviews here, I was skeptical about getting this model. I've been using Dewalt tools forever now, and I've never once had a problem, so I took the chance. I now have it setup, and it works perfectly. No wobble, it doesn't even walk a bit when running on my workbench w/o being bolted down. Check the video below to see the tool running. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones, and just got a good machine. All of my Dewalt tools work flawlessly, so I'm not surprised to see this one working great too.",
        "I have my grinder set up with 2 wire wheels for cleaning metal. The grinder motor runs smoothly. No bearing noise. The working pedestals are a little on the thin side I would liked for them to be a little heavier metal. Overall a good grinder for the money.",
        "Works good. There's not a whole lot you can say about a bench grinder. But it is very smooth running and has little to no vibration. You will not run out of power with the grinding wheels that come on it. But i put a wire wheel on it and you can bog it down if you push into it hard. but if you more or less let the tool do the work it works fine.",
        "i beat the crap out of this everyday and it holds up to my abuse. I do a lot of heavy grinding on a daily basis. Grinder has lots of torque and runs cool. And best of all even when i work it very hard, it just keeps on going.",
        "I have been slowly replacing my tools with DeWalt's for several years, because they are so well made, and last for a long time. The end result using Dewalt products is that you wind up doing a better job on your projects. I was using my DeWalt jig saw the other day, and marveled at how precise I could make the cuts thanks to its quality. This Bench grinder is no different. The motor doesn't \"bog down\" when you grind a piece of metal, like my old one does. Great products!!",
        "This is a smooth running, reasonably powered bench grinder. Only two complaints I have is there is no way to connect a dust collection system and the tool rests are OK, but could easily stand to be a little beefier.",
        "Other reviews claimed wheels were out of line but mine were perfect delivered June 2017, so maybe they fixed the quality control, plus they gave me a special discount on price (probably due to some previous poor reviews). Good quality grinder.",
        "At first glance it seems like a decent grinder, but there is a lot of vibration on my workbench when its running. Not sure if thats normal, took off one grinding wheel and replaced with dewalt wire wheel. Maybe that caused it to be unbalanced? My old 6\" delta had less vibration.",
        "This is a very capable grinder. You will not be disappointed. Plenty of torque and won't bogg down much when used properly.",
        "A gift for my son from his wish list, I love Amazon wish list feature. You can gift to others the EXACT thing they want, deliered to their door with a message from you. And He uses his gift to finish items and give me a gift. Happy Mama",
        "I was somewhat skeptical on purchasing this grinder due to the negative comments concerning undo vibration. After assembly and mounting to a steel bench table, I found NO vibration at all. The unit is very powerful and does not stall out when grinding heavy metal objects. This is a very good product from Dewalt.",
        "I bought this despite the reviews stating that it vibrates alot. It is not a joke, even on the stand, it will move across the floor. I will have to take it apart and see if I can make it run smooth, but for now I have to stand on the stand to use it.",
        "Works well, but I wish it had a shut down brake. It spins for a LONG time after it is powered down.",
        "This is my second Dewalt DW-758. I was so satisfied with the first one as a grinding wheel unit I purchased the second to run wire wheels so as not to need changing wheels for different jobs.",
        "Before you order this 8-inch grinder, make sure you know what exactly that means in terms of size. This thing is a beast! That being said, I really like this product. It has a lot of muscle behind it; so much that it doesn't even start to bog down when I am doing some serious grinding on severely rusted rail road ties and other higher quality knife steel. Its quiet, not too bad vibration, and smooth. I recommend this grinder.",
        "Works great. It does vibrate but it’s amazing compared to my old harbor freight one. Can’t complain.",
        "This grinder was very poorly balanced as others have experienced. It hit a resonant frequency when it was coming up to speed which vibrated tools off of my bench, damaging one chisel which I could not then re-sharpen because the grinding surface was so inconsistent. I imagine that the bearings in the unit would not last long with the vibration in the unit. I returned it and will be looking elsewhere for a replacement. Also, the instructions were very poorly written.",
        "This grinder is a BEAST. It has been used weekly in a high school sculpture & ceramics setting for the last two years and hasn't had a single issue. The stock wheels that come on it have held up well and work great at the high rpms it rotates at. The tool/media rests are also pretty solid and easy to assemble.",
        "This grinder is big and powerful enough to do almost any job. If installed properly, there is little to no vibration.",
        "Nice powerful grinder. It is bigger than I expected. I could have gotten away with the 6 inch grinder for around the house. That being said, due to the vibrations of the grinder the safety shields vibrate and make a very loud noise. Touch the shields and the sound goes away.",
        "A good quality grinder for a reasonable price, wish it came with a wire wheel instead of 2 grind wheels but the wire wheels are readily available",
        "Best price here dare to compare plenty of power better than a 6” shipped fast to",
        "I purchased this unit to sharpen mower blades and keep other lawn implements ready for use. It saves a trip to the shop to have this done every fall, and saves the cost of sharpening various items (axe, mower blades on the riding and push mowers, etc.) It will easily pay for itself in a few years, and is conveniently at home. It works great, was well balanced and has the features I needed most to include eye protection in addition to the set you would wear when using equipment. Great buy!",
        "The Dewalt table grinder appears to be very good item for cost.",
        "I have used DEWALT bench grinders in the past and they were very good after having one stolen, I just ordered another DEWALT because of my previous experience. Bad mistake I have received two different grinders both had wheels that were out round and neither of the grinder wheels were true side to side, they both vibrated so badly as to be unusable. Amazon was great they sent return prepaid shipping labels and refunded my money, with no hassles. I then ordered a different brand grinder and am very happy with it. Also Amazon gets 5 stars for the way they do business. Thanks you make online buying a great way to purchase needed item. Garyb",
        "This 6” grinder, which I have used only twice, seems to be good quality. Every little vibe ration.",
        "I got this mostly to sharpen chisels, both job site and my set for fine wood carving. This grinder is perfect for this task, I highly recommend it-",
        "Mine was damaged in shipping (something amazon needs to work on) due to poor packaging. One of the guards was mashed which meant the tool rest was not plumb to one of the wheels. Repeated whacks with a dead blow hammer and about 30 minutes of tinkering fixed the issue. The stones ran true with no wobble or need for dressing. Very little vibration.",
        "After opening the box, I saw that there were some superficial scratches on some of the parts. These scratches were on a section of the grinder that was black, and someone had colored over the scratch with a marker... this leads me to think it might be a factory rebuild because I can't think why a brand-new DeWalt product would have scratches out of the box. In all, the grinder works great after about an hour of use. Some assembly required, the stones are both labeled as DeWalt stones and on is a course and the other is a fine. Don't expect these stones to be true or well surfaced. I do think the grinder runs quiet and smooth.",
        "Bought this for my son who uses it for all kinds of things when restoring ATV's. He said it runs quiet, very little vibration if any and doesn't bogg down when doing heavy grinding or polishing.",
        "No issues or complaints so far. Not a heavy user but when I need it I need it! Putting the shields together was FUN! Whew!",
        "Not your typical Dewalt quality. Looks exactly like lower end grinders, with Dewalt painted on it. Even when I put wheels that I knew were well balanced from another grinder on it, it still vibrated way more than what should be acceptable.",
        "The grinder works perfect and very easy to put togeather I picked up a stand from harbor freight and it mounted up perfectly!",
        "Had horrible vibration. Dewalt usaully makes great stuff, this just must be a lemon",
        "I have this mounted down to my work bench. I use it a fair amount and haven't had any trouble with it. My only complaints would be that the guards aren't as adjustable as I would hope and that the tool rest had to be bent a little in order to fit in place properly. Otherwise it seems like a good machine. I use it mostly for grinding metal in my shop, a little bit of wood too.",
        "I bought 3 of these bench grinders. They are very well built and my shop uses them on a daily bases. I highly recommend these.",
        "As others have noted the grinder does have a vibration to it. I've seen much worse on other machines but it doesn't run as smooth as it should. I'm going to try a set of machined washers to see if I can get to run smoother.",
        "Nice grinder for the price even though it is China. Got a Dewalt 25 dollars off and it was on sale. Ended up paying $82 to the door. Can't beat that anywhere! Read reviews on this item but we had used these at work so I know they are decent quality. Already using mine with no issues.",
        "Great bench grinder for the shop! I put a wire wheel on one side, and a stone on the other. No vibration, quiet, powerful, and it simply works. What more can you say abut a good bench grinder?",
        "I have yet to put this to work. I know it will do a fine job as I have used bench grinders like this in the past. I recommend it!",
        "I did a lot of searching for performance and quality for price. This wasn't easy to find. This is probably still made in china, but most models is stock at the brick and mortar stores are less powerful and what I would call junk (not the word I really wanted to use).",
        "Works well, well balanced. Be sure to use paper gaskets on either side of your wheels and to face them off with a diamond face tool.",
        "Decent grinder for the price I paid. Like many people have said it does have some balance issues. I had to replace one of the wheels almost immediately. Called Dewalt up and they sent me one for free. I use the little WEN stand with it suits my needs. Just don't expect a Baldor for what you are paying.",
        "To their credit they sent me a new stone for free (one extra star for customer service), but the unit wants to vibrate itself to death and is a pain to use because it's hitting the material unevenly. Waste of money, wish I hadn't bought it.",
        "This grinder makes projects much easier. With the stand it takes up minimal space.",
        "Having trouble keeping the guard from unscrewing due to the shaking",
        "Very nice grinder. Lots of power and large debris shields.",
        "I’ve beat the balls off this thing since I purchased it. Keeps on going.",
        "I love this thing. Haven't had any issues with it. I don't know what people are talking about when then they say it vibrates alot. Mine hardly vibrates at all. Definitely worth it.",
        "This was a gift to my husband & he hasn’t opened it yet.",
        "To this point I am happy with the performance of this bench grinder. I have it set up on a floor stand and only use the wire wheels on it. We shall see how long it lasts.",
        "This woman loves her bench grinder. No wobble. Long lasting stones. Super high revolution rate for smoothness in all of my projects.",
        "I absolutely love this thing. The extra power makes fabrication jobs much easier. I always hated having to baby my previous grinder. This one needs no such treatment. I would highly recommend it.",
        "I had to return first unit to Amazon due to excess vibration coming from both wheels. I spent significant amount of time trying to rectify the problem and gave up. Both wobble radially as well as laterally. Ordered second one that had even worst wobbling. Contacted Dewalt and got a new wheel, guess what, it also wobbles. I am returning the second one and will stay clear from that grinder and you should do the same.",
        "this is my first Grinder and I am very impressed with it I cant find anything wrong to say",
        "Good product, but I found here was a small amount of vibration with my unit right out of the box, as other reviewers mentioned. A quick dressing and balancing resolved this issue relatively easily. I would buy again."
