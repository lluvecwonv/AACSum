        "We switched one of our old Harbor Freight specials at the shop for this one. I was skeptical that it would be that much better, but this is a serious grinder. The wheels don't wobble, it's powerful as can be, and it's silent compared to all of our other grinders. The price is hefty, but will worth it if you are using it daily. We will be switching out all of our grinders for Jets in the coming months. Update 9/14 We ordered another a month ago and it is working perfectly in our shop. They’re pricey, but we would happily pay double considering the time it’s saved us compared to cheap models.",
        "I procrastinated on whether to spend the extra $100 and get the Jet 8\" and it was worth every penny! It runs quiet, runs true and the ported outlets can easily be connected to transport the waste. I have used other brands over the past 20 years and they are OK, but....Not often that I get excited but this is a really great unit!",
        "Arrived in perfect order. Assembly was straightforward. This grinder exudes quality; it feels very well built. After reading many reviews of lesser grinders, then visiting the three big box stores within 100 miles, all other choices were chintzy with wobbly wheels and lower power. It purrs like a kitten, running smooth and quiet, but grinds like a tiger with no bogging down when I lay metal to it. Wonderful tool that will outlive me. I am so glad I bumped the budget up to a Jet.",
        "First class bench grinder. Runs smooth, no vibration, etc. This is only the second Jet machine I have purchased but would rate the quality in the same league as Snap On. There are a few things that could be better, the tool rests are a little a small and a work light is not standard equipment, but you can purchase a LED work light from Jet for about $60. I'll never buy another bench grinder with 6\" wheels after using this one which has 8\" wheels. The wheels produce an excellent surface finish on chisels, etc.",
        "I received my grinder today , I set it in the work bench and fired it off . Somewhat Leary from some of the not so great reviews . To my satisfaction it fired right up and ran as smooth as silk no vibration no odd noises or smells . I grabbed the nearest piece of steel I could find and it took entirely to much pressure to slow it down mind you I was trying to stop it completely. It slowed a bit as expected and kept right on grinding . I would definitely recommend this grinder to anyone looking for a great product at an affordable price .",
        "This jet grinder has lot's of power I bought it to sharpen my lawn mower blades & never bogged down. The machine gets up to speed quickly & is very heavy I don't have it screwed into my work bench there's no need to as there pretty much NO vibration. I highly recommend this grinder you will not be disappointed. 5 stars!",
        "Great grinder, almost no vibration and all the parts are heavy duty (not cheap sheet metal). Had bought a Ryobi 8\" grinder (BG828G) from Home Depot, it shook so bad it was completely unusable (on a pedestal stand it just wanted to dance across the floor) , the only good part of it was the LED lights. I guess you get what you pay for. Actually now that I think about it the Ryobi grinder might make a good paint shaker...",
        "So glad I made this choice ! It has exceeded my need for a great grinder. Smooth as silk, no vibration and very,very little noise. It performs perfect for my needs in a grinder. Going in I was fully aware of the inadequate tool rest but I had also knew I had the \"One way Wolverine Jig\" waiting on it and this combination is a real setup. Glad to share the Info. for those out there looking or considering buying one. If you do I hope you'll have the pleasure that I am having with mine. Good luck and happy grinding !",
        "This grinder replaced a older unit. Same model. Pleased with how quite it is. The only recommendation I have is that they include a template that could be used to drill holes in the shop bench to mount the grinder.",
        "awesome bench grinder. I am usually picky on the brands I buy, i was real hesitant to buy this, but I am very satisfied and really glad that I purchased it.",
        "I have not had much time to use this machine,,but it is quite similar to the powermatic. It is a strong machine and will take off as much material as you need. The price was fair.",
        "Really good bench grinder for the money. Powerful and sturdy",
        "Bought this as a gift for my husband. Hasn't used it yet due to finding out he had cancer right after receiving it. He's very excited and happy with it though. Better than he had hoped for. Says it's good quality, and I agree.",
        "This is a great grinder. Worth the extra money over the cheepper models.",
        "I use a wire wheel in my home shop a lot to get the scale off of steel. This unit has plenty of power and doesn't bog down under heavy loads. I've had no problems since the day I bought it.",
        "This is a True Industrial Grinder.!!! I Buy JET Products for My Fab / Welding Shop.!!! They are Always Ready to do the Job.!!! Never a Problem....",
        "Replaced a six inch discount store grinder. Big difference. Good price, too",
        "Removing the screws from the spark guards was an ordeal - I had to go out and get an impact screwdriver because they were tightened by a gorilla on steroids. I stripped the head on one before surrendering and getting the driver. However, the wheels were properly dressed and balanced, and fit and finish were fine.",
        "Good quality. Ton of power, sturdy, and well-built. It's a Jet!",
        "This is a beast of a machine, very robust and quiet, starts up to max rpm in 1 sec. When turning ut of wheels rotate freely for a good long while.",
        "My first bench grinder! Works great bought a scratch and dent ones off of amazon. When it arrived some of the screws were stripped on the sides of the dust shields. A little work with vise grips and came right off. Well built very heavy! Doesn't slow down when grinding at all!",
        "You can buy much cheaper grinders, but the you would have to use them. Buy the best and it will last a life time.",
        "Replaced a 1/2 HP grinder that would kick out under load and drove me crazy. This has tons of power and does my jobs in a fraction of the time as the old one. Love it!",
        "The grinder holds up under long hours of work. The grinder does not reduce power or speed when used heavily. It has little to no vibration. It is very quiet. Holds its own during large industrial projects!",
        "I use this product for our shop. It meets all OSHA guidelines as far as I can tell and I am very happy with it. This took the place of an older Sunnex Grinder. As far as the quality goes, this product is far superior!",
        "I like it so much this is the second one I bought. At least the Jet has enough power to use for fairly heavy grinding.",
        "Well made, quiet. Will wait to see how it holds up ... my last Dayton lasted 40 years...",
        "Compared to the smaller cheaper one that I own, this grinder is stronger and quieter. I am happy with it.",
        "Does not run true. This is not a problem with the washers. The shaft on one side is has a slight runout and this is not correctable. Poor quality control. I have an older model of the same Jet grinder which runs perfectly.",
        "Replaced the previous grinder of the same model. A real workhorse.",
        "The grinder went boom in a puff of smoke after 10 seconds of use. The good part is Amazon has a flawless return procedure and I had a good working replacement in a matter of days.",
        "Plenty powerful and does the job well. The last one we had lasted 10 years in a metal shop.",
        "What I wanted was a powerful 8 inch grinder. This has a 1 hp induction motor. It is very heavy, doesn't vibrate, and starts up to full speed fast. It's awesome for the price. Others with equal power are twice the price. No light. Simple project rests and effective eye shields are just fine. Grizzly offers one for about twice the price which is very highly rated, but it was too much money for me. Packaging was excellent. Arrived very fast.",
        "really haven't use to much yet but seems nice no issues at this time.",
        "Brought this for a Christmas gift. Very nice; runs very smooth and quiet compare to my old (cheap) grinder. Now I wish my old one would die so I could get this Jet model.",
        "IT WAS FINALLY TIME TO RETIRE OUR OLD SIOUX BENCH GRINDER. THIS JET GRINDER IS A GREAT REPLACEMENT GRINDER, WE ALSO PURCHASED THE JET GRINDER STAND.",
        "It is heavy, and powerful. There is a bit of vibration and yes, it is bolted down. Perhaps better quality wheels would change that. In any case, I would buy another if I needed it. It's much ceaper than a Baldor and better than any grinder i have ever had.",
        "OWN three for my shops... used by many and holding up.",
        "Wheels are perfectly balanced out of the box. Motor is powerful enough to sharpen mower blades and not bog down. Would recommend",
        "Love it, great quality, very powerful, heavy duty. Cons: - lots of momentum and power means extra time to stop - No mounting holes for Jet 578100 Led light - Wish I would have been able to buy the woodworking grinder tool rests for this separately - If using a sharpening jig and these tool rests, be aware it will push the jig to the top of the wheel, so a new tool rest fabrication is needed to lower and extend the tool rest if this is your desired use.",
        "The first one came in cracked, and the same day I got it back in the mail (for free) the new one was already there...This one blew a fuse or something and same thing, post man dropped a new one off when he picked up the old. The third one has been awesome!!!! AWESOME!!! My husband uses it for everything, and moves it around all over and holds up great. I was glad we didn't give up because of a fluke with the first two. Worth it!",
        "I have read many reviews on this item and bought one to see if it would do my small shop. Out of the box on a bench it ran smooth with no noticeable vibration, I mostly us it for tool cutting an sharpening and dollar for dollar it was a great choice.",
        "I use my Jet grinder a lot for De burring and it works great. Another quality product from Jet.",
        "My 8\" Jet grinder has been a huge improvement in my shop. (My old grinder was a 6\" model and 30 years old.) I can now sharpen bush hog blades very quickly. All the usual smaller tasks go very well too. This machine is very rugged and the wheel guards, tool rests and eye shields are all very steady and vibration free when in use. It is a practical machine and does not bog down when subjected to hard work. An optional light that is as rugged and practioal and vibration free as the grinder would be a welcome addition. I have my machine installed on a Jet pedestal stand and it makes a great combination.",
        "Made in China and they lost something in the translation. Fit and finish very poor. Wheel covers out of alignment. Vibration is excessive. Needs major rework right out of the box. I have other Jet power tools and this one has convinced me I have enough of them. Do yourself a favor and save the time it takes you to order this. I gave it 2 stars because I don't really hate anything, if I did it would have gotten 1 star, it's that bad, too bad I used to think Jet was a good brand.",
        "I was disappointed with the Jet product. The first one would not run. it to 2 to get one right. The second on had guard issues, and between the 2 one works fine. the manufacturer did make it right. I have other Jet products. this one disappointed.",
        "Just now got the JET 8\" grinder that I ordered. I spent the extra money thinking that I was going to get the USA made model that was advertised. I was shocked when I saw (made in Taiwan) on the box. I went back to AMAZON and found that they had changed the description, the origin and the price. I could have bought this foreign made piece of s**t seventeen dollars cheaper. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!",
        "The best grinder out there. It is really strong and you can apply a lot of pressure to it. Amazon prime had Fast shipping.",
        "Grinding wheel guards were lose do to the screws that hold them in place are striped out . When I started the motor, it needed to be helped to get going. The grinding wheels came apart throwing peaces all over the shop. It was very dangerous I could have been seriously hurt. In short worst grinder ever. I think it was a used grinder , looks like it was disassembled in the past.I wouldn't recamend it to my worst enemy.",
        "You want the best grinder for your money? This is it! Great power and super quiet. The original wheels aren't even terrible. Best grinder you can get without breaking the bank!",
        "Strong & start up is pretty quick. Motor is said to be a long lasting strong motor when I did my research. I recommend a wire brush wheel & grinding wheel set up.",
        "I've used it for a few years, and never had a problem. Strong, runs great. I put a wire brush wheel on one side and use it to clean metal, and the stone to sharpen welding tips, a cheap chisel, and lawn mower blades. The extra horsepower is worth the cost.",
        "Actually cancelled the order but have another one of these and works great for years at auto repair business",
        "I had to remove the right hand end of the grinder as the wheel was broken in half due to poor packaging, and also the cast iron spark guard on the end was smashed into multiple segments. The grinder does not seem any better or smoother or more powerful that other less expensive 3/4 hp models I have. Do your shopping and beware of the way heavy items are packaged.",
        "BOUGHT ONE LAST YEAR VERY LITTLE USE JUST BURNT OUT",
        "Out of the box, I never expected this grinder to have a 1/2\" of wobble on the wheels. Ended up getting a Metabo instead. Jet tools are pure crap and I should have known better even trying one of these, let alone 2!! Amazon was awesome helping me out til I was happy and I give them an A+ for that.",
        "Upon initial use, cutting wheel had too much side to side movement...too much for accurate cutting! Previous Jet Bench grinders also had on/off switch issues (burning out).",
        "I just got it on the stand and hooked up. I have tried it once and it works well. I am disappointing because I learned that Jet makes a better tool rest than the fixed cast one on this grinder. The tool rests cost $75 ea at Jet and the price for the required two with tax and shipping is almost the total cost of the grinder.",
        "This bench grinder showing a pale white I order from amazon 3 time and 3 time I got the silver what a disappointing. I really like the white one but Iam having a bad time getting one",
        "Nice grinder. It runs smoothly and quietly and it's great for manicures (just kidding, about the manicures). Don't drink and grind.",
        "I've used this grinder for years to sharpen mower blades. I don't ever see it wearing out."
