        "My amazon packages finally fit! Half the time the boxes weee crammed in there so hard I could barely remove them. Looks nice and isn't to terribly. Side by side vs standard box since it was try hard to gauge based on dimensions. Driving down the street you barely notice that it's bigger.",
        "I am not trying to be dramatic with this one star review, but the dimensions they give for this mailbox are completely inaccurate and I think that's pretty unacceptable. It states the box is 8.72\" wide x 10.88\" tall. Ours was 8\" wide x 10\" tall. We bought it specifically believing an average medium-sized box, such as a USPS Medium Flat Rate Box, would fit, but they do not. If the actual size was what they claim, it would do perfectly. We instead had to buy the next size up, which is almost absurdly large, but we do like it a lot and would recommend it if you send or receive a lot of small or medium-sized packages.",
        "My old, standard size mailbox was damaged by a falling branch. I replaced it with the large sized Gibraltar. I attached the box to a scrap 2x8 with a couple of thin spacers to ensure a snug fit. I then attached the mailbox to the post (a metal pipe sandwiched between 2x4s) using inexpensive, heavy duty shelving braces. A quick and easy installation. The Gibraltar is well constructed and very solid. I am happy with it and I know the postal lady appreciates the size because it is easier for her to place the frequent small boxes that I receive, and less trips to my door.",
        "I went to put it up as soon as I got it and it's huge! Its a big boy! I know our neighborhood mail man will no longer be upset with me for having to deal with my broken down old, hanging off the rail mailbox. Cheap but it is super huge and gets the job done. You can get lost in this mailbox.",
        "This is a good quality mailbox that is easy to install. The size is perfect for recieving packages from big A and others. Price is reasonable. The door works good and has a positive lock that can be adjusted, so that it want flop open. This is a wear item and in 5-10 years will need to be replaced. The door is the achilles heel as it takes alot of abuse. Still, it's an excellent product. As more and more sellers will be using the USPS for last mile delivery, you are going to need a box this size.",
        "nice and big!! we get a lot of packages so our lady was always having to come to the door, this was a nice color green that blends in with our gardening. hard to choose white or black when there is really none of those colors on my house. The green was a toss up but i'm glad i got it. its not too large where neighbors are wondering but it is large enough to fit shutterfly books, shirts, magazines, and all the adds+mail with no issues. fit on our old post that held a standard size box. rained last week, mailbox held up fine.",
        "Awesome Mailbox. Sturdy, metal and large. It looks just like the Charlie Brown mailbox with mounted on a simple post.",
        "You know how people can go on about how much they hate putting together IKEA furniture? That is what this rant is. The person who designed this was high. A good looking, standard mailbox--All is will with that. It is the directions, the parts, and available holes for the mount easily tops anything by IKEA for strange design and incoherent instructions. I have approached setting this up several times since it was delivered almost two months ago and it has defeated me every time.",
        "This is a replacement for the exact same box that has been out in the elements (rain, sleet, snow, heat, humidity, frigid temps, you name it) for over 17 years. It still looks good but one small part rusted through and since we have to replace the post and remove the whole box anyways, we thought we would get a new one. The size is perfect, can fit a shoe box and a text book but not overly large and the color is good during the summer to reflect the heat of the sun. Even if you find this one in a big box store, it will be more expensive.",
        "Unsatisfactory!! The door on my old mailbox would not stay shut so I replaced it with this one. This one's latch is just a simple clip and I had to bend it just to get the door to stay shut!! I recommend spending a few more $$ to get one with a magnetic latch.",
        "My son will be here in July and to installed the mailbox so I can't say much about installation. It will be place on a rural route next to the road so there was no need for a locked one. The current on is 15 years old ,rusted and was hit by a car so I needed a new one. I purchase this size so our mailman doesn't have to come down a long driveway in the winter which can be treacherous. This box is sturdy. Much Much better made than the ones at 'big box store'. And I like that it is not standard black...I like being a bit different.",
        "I bought the same one last summer. Unfortunately, a driver backed into it and it needed to be replaced. I liked the first one so well that I just re-ordered the same one. It is very serviceable, but with a little thinner gauge metal than the old time ones. Only caveat is that isn't packaged very well. It arrived with two dents. I didn't have time to return and with the thin packaging wasn't certain that the replacement would be any better. Dents pushed out almost all of the way.",
        "This would have been a great product.... but the door wouldnt stay shut! I had to take plyers to the top of the mailbox and bend it in for the latch to keep the door shut. Something so small that ruined the whole thing for me. I do like how there are multiple attachment points along the bottome which made it really easy to install that felt really solid and secure. Fix the latch problem and it gets 5 stars.",
        "The mailbox is nice but poorly packed. It's not Amazon's fault but the mailbox came dinged and the front latch flattened completely. I didn't complain to Amazon because they boxed it nicely. This thing needs some foam padding. However, 5 HUGE stars for the system to mount the mailbox. I used these two items and it took me like 30 minutes start to finish. The longest thing it took was putting the numbers on the mailbox so they were straight on both sides of the mailbox. Really good system for installation.",
        "I carefully checked that this mailbox was compatible with the Gibraltar post, Model WP000W01, which I purchased. The post was supposed to have all the needed parts for mounting this mailbox, but the mounting plate that came with the post is definitely too small for this large mailbox. Our handyman will have to purchased a wood panel on which to mount on the bottom of the mailbox to be able to mount it on this post, and it will mean extra expense. The models of Gibraltar mailboxes and posts that Amazon claims are compatible are INCORRECT. Check with the manufacturer.",
        "I have a very large mailbox already and was purchasing this one for my sister as a gift. The picture showed a very large mailbox, just like the one I already have, but when it arrived, it was not the large one I wanted. I am keeping it, but am not satisfied with what I received. Will not do business with this company ever again.",
        "It was a very good value. Certainly an upgrade from the small faded mailbox that I inherited when I purchased my house. Installation was easy - Cut a piece of plywood to fit on the bottom of the mailbox, screw the plywood via the sides of the mailbox, That affects the mailbox to the post with the screws from the previous mailbox.",
        "The mailbox appears to have been made well for the most part. But the door is not staying up on my mailbox, which does not make for a very secure mailbox. the door appears to have been made slightly bigger than the opening, so it is not snug enough to stay up. Apart from that, it is good.",
        "It's a shame our local post office has refused to deliver our mail ever since we moved the mailbox and replaced our previous one with this, because this is by far the best mailbox I have ever had. It's sturdy, it's big, and it's simple. No bells or whistles, just a big honking mailbox with enough room to house larger than normal packages you might normally find at your door. When attached to a soundly secured post this thing was like a rock, way better than the swinging mailbox we had before. (I feel sorry for the next bloke that decides to try and run this bad boy over, a problem we often have with our neighbors.)",
        "We live in the country and have dogs so our mail carrier won't pull into the drive unless it's a very large package, so I decided to purchase this mailbox to be able to fit almost everything we receive in the mail. It's a very large set and I'm really pleased with it, although I had to do a lot of improvising to attach it to the cemented pole we had from our previous (very old) mailbox. It does not come with any kind of mounting hardware, so be sure to have one ready before you attempt to install.",
        "Gibraltar Elite Large mailbox, black. Wanted a large mailbox. This fit the bill. Poor quality on build. Door scrapes on open/close, scraping the paint. Only the visible exterior of mailbox was painted. Interior areas were left unpainted except for over spray inside. Was it large enough for me, yes. Would I buy this again, no. This will have to do until I find a better mailbox. I did buy the Gibraltar aluminum post unit, that was good.",
        "This is the standard well made mailbox. But this is NOT the LARGE capacity that we think of. This measures 9x11x23 rather than 11x15x24 that we expect with the large capacity. This is a regular size post mounted mailbox.",
        "I wanted to write this review for anybody else that had the same issue. Everything was great about the mailbox it's functioning just fine for me. However some models apparently have trouble closing. the metal clip that it's supposed to retain the door once you close it did not hold well. It was a simple fix. All I did was take some pliers and bent the metal clip upward and the door retained nicely. Just an FYI for all of you",
        "Perfect in every way, even can easily adjust flag tension with a click. Love the powder coat idea, solved years of problems past. No faults found, only to mention there's not a firm click when closing up to insure weather doesn't open & soak contents ... we'll see. I was given the impression this was a twin to replace my mailbox but Nooooo, mine is termed \"extra large\". Oh well, this might be better after all and large packages should be brought to porch anyway.",
        "Was surprised at how big this bad boy is. The postman should be a happy camper, no more cramming my amazon packages into my dilapidated rust bucket . Now I'm the envy of the neighborhood until the Joneses out do me. Sturdy box and a great white glossy finish. Think I'll wrap it with a magnetic stars and stripes.",
        "The metal on the dome was bent and the door did not stay closed. The buyer did not pay to return the item. Cost me $20 to return. I lost money. Not worth it.",
        "I purchased this mailbox as we moved to the Country and I wanted a box big enough for smaller packages but still manageable. I painted the box to suit my fancy as well. The flag was super easy to remove and re install so it stayed red and the entire box is VERY sturdy. The door securely closes as well and you have to want to open it for it to open. Installation was not as easy as I would have liked but for where we live I had to have a larger post set \"backwards\" to keep it off the road enough but close enough for the postman. Extremely happy with my project and purchase!",
        "I purchased this because in the description it states that there is an adjustable latch. This feature was the main selling point for me. It turns out that bending the latch with a pair of pliers is what you have to do to adjust it. With near daily use and any adjustments the weld for the latch will weaken and break off. This is what happened to the one we are trying to replace! The wind blows the door open (thus needing a strong latch) and rain gets in where the latch broke off.",
        "Large mailbox, can replace Walpole Woodworker 21 inch gal. coated mailbox and take vinyl lettering easily. Model does not lock and outgoing mail arm secure and solid. Several holes on bottom you may want to seal if in high humidity climate. Would love for Gibraltar to offer mail plate than slides in and out for packages and offered as kit (offered by higher end models). This was great price and a little better than driving to big box store to get. After lettering I'd leaned mailbox post against by accident and left a small divot, very minor. Paid <$27 for this delivered within 2 days using Prime. Vinyl lettering from Walpole Woodworkers was $39 and took longer.",
        "This box is big enough to hold a weeks worth of mail or some large packages (as long as they aren't too wide (max width is 8 3/4\". 21\" in length should take plenty of mail. Pre-drilled holes on both sides for your outdoor screws to mount the box to a piece of (self-supplied) plywood. Attach the plywood to your post extension first! Make sure your box is correctly aligned per USPS specs. They can be fussy.",
        "Purchased this mailbox along with a redwood post, they were separate purchases, but came in the same package. I did not order it for safety features, it is large, waterproof, the door stays shut, and the flag stays up if it is used. I had to purchase screws to mount this mailbox to the post, and also drill 8 pilot holes. The screws had to be done by hand from inside the mailbox, but it is pretty large-so it was time consuming, but not bad since I knew that when I ordered it.",
        "When an early morning single-vehicle accident truncated the power pole and our rural route mail box tree, I decided to replace our cedar covered box with a large capacity box. The green looks ever so beautiful with 4-inch chrome numbers. The Texas DOT installed the mailbox (we left it a the post office); thus, it was a breeze to install! The interior is exceptionally roomy so that most of my packages fit, generating less trips to the post office. One light mail days, a single piece of mail looks lonely inside. Last but not least, the price was ever so reasonable.",
        "Well made metal mail box, a little bit bigger than standard. All dimentions are an inch or two larger. Doesn't look too huge sitting on my mail box post, but has more room for those small Amazon boxes. I cut a 1x10 down to the width matching mail box, then screwed 1x10 to my 6x6 post. So then new mail box screws nicely into 1x10 cut down to aprox 1x8 (can't use a 1x8 because they are not a full 8\").",
        "I didn't know what kind of support mechanism this mailbox used to attach to the post I had. So I didn't know if it was going to be easy or difficult to mount the mailbox. When I received the mailbox, I knew what I had to do in terms of adjusting my post configuration. So, that part was easy, except that the post addition I bought didn't account for the size of the mailbox. But I made it fit and the white mailbox on a white post looks great! The mailbox is holding up well and expect it to last for a long time, unless some careless driver knocks it down.",
        "I love it! As a former letter carrier I appreciate a nice mailbox. Thank you!",
        "We didn't realize till we put it up that it was considerably larger than our old one. But our mail carrier stopped me on the street and thanked us that it's larger. She said it was so much easier to put in the mail, and many smaller packages fit, too. It takes a slightly firm tug to open it--it's not going to fall open, thankfully. A good mailbox.",
        "I live in a subdivision that is overseen by a homeowners association. They kindly told me to replace my rusty mailbox (or else) with a PARTICULAR SIZE mailbox which I couldn't find at any local hardware store. Enter Amazon with the right size mailbox at an excellent price. I painted the post and put the new mailbox on it and can now rest assured in the fact I will no longer be hounded by those buggers.",
        "The door wouldn't stay closed. There is a tab that keeps it shut but I didn't try to bend it into working position as I know that every bend will weaken the metal. Otherwise, it was a great mailbox. Dimensions on the ad are very good. It isn't a thin metal box, it is pretty sturdy. They were great about giving me a refund for it.",
        "Large and sturdy. Has holes for attaching to a post or slab of wood on the side along the bottom or in the bottom. The lit fits securely and is metal. We used a 4” pipe shelf flange to mount on 3.5” existing round solid pipe post, with a liner in the flange to cap the existing post. We mounted a wood board under the bottom rim base of the mailbox. This worked great.",
        "The size is just right, big enough to accept most mailed packages, but not as big as some rural mailboxes. The fit and finish were as expected, although it hasn't been installed long enough to give an opinion on how well it will survive Ohio winters with road salt and snow plow attacks. So far, I'm very satisfied with it, as is my mail carrier.",
        "the problem is it doesn't come with a mounting bracket and doesn't advise you on which one to get. It's too wide and holes don't align to use my existing bracket. finally called the manufacturer who said the plastic universal mounting bracket will work. It's only 6\" but there are tabs to flip out and adapt it to 8.7\" . Amazon should really put this information in the listing",
        "I bought the Gibraltar steel mailbox mounting board for 10.97 at Lowes and it made installing this on an L bracket super easy. My previous mail box had a wood mounting board, but it rotted away. This mailbox is very sturdy and doesn't look oversized, but it's plenty big for most of my packages and large mailing envelopes. Highly recommend this!",
        "This mailbox is installed on a white Gibraltar Brighton Rust-Resistant Aluminum Universal Mailbox Post, BP000W01. A flatbed \"carrier,\" towed by a pickup truck, creamed the post/mailbox we had. We had a really large capacity box, but couldn't find anything comparable in white. Gibraltar doesn't make their largest box (with the eagle imprint on the pull down door) in the color white. While this mailbox (E1600W00) is called \"large capacity,\" we think \"medium capacity\" is more descriptive. It does hold a lot, & we're not disappointed---just receive lots of mail & small shipping boxes..",
        "Works fine, like the larger size and metal clasp. You will need to cut your own wood base to mount it on as the smaller standard versions will not work if you want to use the screws on the side, but any piece std mailbox mounting plate will work if you use the screws in the middle bottom of the mailbox. We did not want screws on the floor of our box, so we cut a piece of plywood and used the side screw holes.",
        "For the price, I don’t have any major complaints, but honestly I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. The mailbox itself is fine, the size is great and can fit lots of small packages! However the flag is already chipping paint along the edges and the door flaps open half the time. I replaced my last mailbox because of the door issue, and I am super disappointed that this one is doing the same.",
        "I ordered this mailbox to replace a plastic box that was destroyed by the elements. First off, its kinda big...much larger than my old box and most of my neighbors boxes, but not in an obvious way. It's extremely roomy inside and feels really solid. We went to our local big box store to purchase a metal mount that made installation a breeze. So far I'm happy.",
        "It is a decent regular sized Mailbox. Was advertised as LARGE. That is why I only gave it three stars. Decided to keep and use it rather than send it back. Mailman and UPS now have to walk to the House with large packages. Doesn't happen that often. Next time I will request ACTUAL DIMENSIONS !",
        "**update** 9/18/16 I still like this mailbox but it never wants to stay closed!!! It is holding up well so far, but it is very hard to keep shut. Great mailbox! Very sturdy and holds more than I expected!",
        "biggest rural residential box me or my friends have found. Mailman likes it since we do a bit of ebay buying.",
        "Well made, tasteful hunter green color and large capacity, all make this a great purchase. I ordered 3\" white vinyl die-cut number stickers from Amazon (Super-Deals-Outlet) for stark visibility against the dark green mailbox background, and it looks great! I am particularly happy that this is a large size mailbox that can accommodate parcels beyond regular mail. Less trips to the front door for my mailman and no packages left out in the rain,. Very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommend.",
        "After pricing garden hose storage items (ceramic jars with lids that cost about $70 - $200 each) we decided to purchase this oversized mailbox for around $20. My husband drilled a hole in the bottom of it and ran the flexihose inside. Very cute with an oversized mailbox wrap that we also bought on Amazon. This metal mailbox will offer weatherproof storage all year round for our garden hose. Very satisfied!",
        "it was as promised, for the price it was ok. I returned it as I felt it was a bit flimsy and didn't really match my neighbors on our share post. Its nice and large, I had one similar and the door always blew open, and could see this occurring again until a truck took out it, my neighbors box the telephone pole between them, a branch of my tree, I digress. For the price point it was good. I liked the color.",
        "Nice, large mailbox. I recently bought a house and got some cute mailbox vinyl decals to put on it. This one fit the bill just right. It was delivered quickly and for the price I'm super happy with it. It was not dented or dinged. The only problem I ran into was that our pole was only about 3 inches so we couldn't directly mount it. One trip to Menard's and an 89 cent piece of lumber fixed that right up. It closes snug but not too snug. I recommend this to anyone wanting a new mailbox and not wanting to spend a ton on one.",
        "The mail delivery person no longer sets my comic books outside my door because I have a large enough mailbox to contain them. Also, the door stays latched, which is great. You wouldn't believe how many mailboxes have doors that just fall open. I couldn't stand that with my last mailbox. I wonder how much of my really important junk mail just blew away during those dark times.",
        "Mailbox was of thin metal, easily bent on installation. Got June 2. By August it is falling apart. Have asked seller to kindly send a replacement. Will update here if that happens. I hope so. I bought this for my parents. I meant for it to be a solution, not a problem.",
        "size is perfect and it was easy to install. I wish it had a wood board to slip under the bottom to connect to our metal post but can't expect everything.as I am sure a lot of customers don't have metal posts.",
        "I desperately needed a new mailbox and was so happy when I came across this one, it was a great price for the size. I was looking for a mailbox larger than my old one because I order a lot of things online and I was tired of my packages being squished in my mailbox. I was excited to receive packages in the mail once I set this mailbox up, so far so good, I haven’t had any issues. I plan on making a decal to sprucen it up a little bit! 😊 I would definitely recommend this mailbox!",
        "Needed a box since for medical reasons I cannot use the cluster mail box. This is larger than I expected ( my fault. ) But it sits upright by my door. It is not posted into ground so I cannot speak to that aspect. Now parcels like books will fit there easily vs being jammed into the tiny cluster.",
        "I bought this product because I wanted a larger mailbox. It certainly is that. The first one I purchased came damaged. Not sure why they send it in the box it comes in which doesn't have packing in it to protect the product. Over all I'm pleased with it. I wish the latch was a little nicer. You can adjust it but it's either too tight or too loose can't seem to find the sweet spot.",
        "At first glance it looks nice but delve in deeper and you will find many flaws. The mailbox is not symmetrical from front to rear, the door latch at best is weak, the entire box is warped from front to rear and the paint job is rushed at best. The quality of this box is marginal and I won't order one again.",
        "Sturdy construction, easy to install, and very roomy. The only thing I'd like to see is a bit better tolerance on the top closure of the door. Ours is just a bit looser than I'd like, and we'll see if I have to bend it a bit to keep it from popping open on its own in the wind/weather. The size is perfect for us - big enough for small and medium sized packages, and large enough for when we just don't get the mail for a few days to not impede our postal carrier (our box isn't in front of our house).",
        "This mailbox is gigantic. Like 3 times the size of all the others on the street. You could fit two adult cats in this thing. I wanted to return it but it's $10 shipping just to return?!?! Now I'm stuck with a stupid giant mailbox that won't fit because it would be jutting out into the road too far, and I STILL need to buy one I can actually use",
        "These are great for us. But, just as a warning for other people, they don't lock! We bought four for two duplexes next to each other. We didn't want or need them to lock. One came dented and Amazon took it back with no hassle. They have an extra large mail capacity.",
        "I needed to replace my old standby mailbox. I picked large thinking my old box was a large. Apparently my old one must have been a medium. Oh, well, this box was much better (size and construction) than my old one. This is a good buy.",
        "Mine came a bit damaged like some others reported and wouldn't stay shut; but a few adjustments and overlooking imperfections and it works ok. it's not a huge amount larger than the standard one I had installed... but it's definitely taller and definitely bigger. certainly worth $16 for the upgrade. other than that, it's a mailbox. if you're expecting fort Knox it something that will get you into A list parties, look elsewhere.",
        "A little bigger in person than in the photos I saw on here, but only by a few inches. Metal frame and flag. Screwed into my existing post. Had to use longer screws though, since the original post was for the smaller standard size. Mounting ware does not come with item, as discribed.",
        "Alittle frustrated. Awesome mailbox. Bigger than my last mailbox. Looks good. Only flaw. The powder coat on cover cracked and chipped off. (If you look at the pic). Kind of fixed it with rustoleum. (Tried to). Wish the attention to detail was better. If it was packaged better maybe the mailbox would look nicer.",
        "This is a big mailbox! Will hold small packages easily. I'm sure the postman appreciates it from cramming things in---LOL Had to change the base to accommodate the box. The pole was fine as it was Just a bigger support board on the bottom. I had a leftover piece of wood that worked just fine---a few screws, 5 minutes of time, and it was mounted and done.",
        "Looks great, very roomy. Needs a receiver strap across the top that can be drilled to match the strap on the door, enabling a lock to be installed. The job of punching the holes along the bottom edge needs improvement, not all are fully punched. Other than those concerns it is a good medium duty mailbox.",
        "the external box it came in looked ok, however the internal original box was damaged and after opening it you could see it had been dropped and the front and rear corners on the ends showed it had been damaged before it was put in the shipping box. I manged to get it repaired , so it looks and works fairly well and got the door to work ok. My response is if I wanted something used and that ,had been damaged I would have found a used one, and not paid for a new one that was damaged.",
        "Nice, large and hefty. Well built except for the flimsy plastic flag. I am happy with it, including the flimsy flag considering it was low priced for the quality and size. The flag should last fine as long as no one mishandles it. I would buy it again if I needed to.",
        "We just installed this mailbox, so I can't speak to long-term performance, but it looks nice! It's quite large. Seems bigger than I remember mailboxes being, but we're cool with that since the postman can now fit larger envelopes and smallish packages actually inside the mailbox.",
        "Nice and sturdy. Large enough for small packages. No complaints. ***update after almost 2 years*** I am downgrading from 5 to 3 stars after 2 years of use. I am finding lots of bugs (ants and spiders) inside the mailbox. I did not have this problem with an old mailbox that I had for over 20 years. There are too many gaps and spaces for bugs to get into the box. Tried to seal around the edges but the gaps from the door hinge are too large.",
        "This mailbox is very nice looking! We now have the nicest mailbox in the neighborhood! This was much bigger than expected but I'm glad it's the size it is since we order a lot of packages and it can fit quite a bit. I am going to recommend it to my neighbors since all of them could use upgrades too!",
        "This was a nice mailbox but it is EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA large. If you are looking for a standard mailbox, this is not it. I would say this is more than double the size of a standard mailbox. We did not measure, so we are at fault for that, but it should be listed as Extra Large, for sure.",
        "Just as advertised but came dented due to possible shipping. Only four stars because it arrived dented due to lack of proper packing and the door knob which keeps it shut does not do such a great job doing so. Which means the door after one shuts it will fall back down via wind or gravity.",
        "This mailbox is lower in price but the quality speaks for itself. Sitting on a shared post with my neighbors, it really stands out being shiny and new. Only time will tell how long its going to last before I have to replace it. The previous one (not this brand) lasted over 10 years.",
        "This mail box was shipped to us \"double boxed\" and came in perfect condition. It has it's own box and then Amazon repackaged it so that it couldn't be dented in shipment. We are very pleased with it. Seems sturdy enough, although \"they don't make them like they used to.\" I feel like it will work out just fine.",
        "This mailbox was a perfect replacement to my original beat up \"bought with house\" one. Just the look on my mailman's face was priceless. The look he gave when he didn't have to slam the beat up door that was rigged on it any longer. I think there was a tear to his eye as he drove off to the next house with a mediocre mailbox. The glossy black finish to this box is an upgrade to the rustic matte black one I originally had. Even nature decided to review my new mailbox, because not only 15 minutes of swapping it out, two bird turds were on top.",
        "Standard mailbox just a bit bigger. I get so many packages from Amazon that I actually needed a larger mailbox and this fits the bill. I couldn't find a mounting block so my husband cut one out of a 2x8 pressure treated board we just happened to have laying around. Worked perfectly. My old mailbox just fit the smallest A1 Amazon box, this one easily hold an A3 Amazon box. Also the color matches my shutters, so win-win for me. There are plenty of pre-drilled holes for mounting and the simple latch works fine and is adjustable.",
        "Great size. Needed one a little bigger for days our rural mail carrier shoves packages into the box like it's Mary Poppins' bag. This saves her the time driving up our long driveway with items that did not fit in the smaller mailbox and protects future packages from the afternoon \" jam\"",
        "This mailbox is the perfect thickness! I was worried it would be flimsy or so heavy, it would be like older mailboxes. It is just perfect! Nice weight, smooth flap operation, and smooth flag raising. When you position the flap or flag, they stay where you put them. It came fully assembled, and I’m completely pleased!!!",
        "The box is great for rural delivery, Our carrier was very pleased. Less trips to our house which is 0.2 miles from the box. The door can be difficult to close at times. It seems to be a bit out of wack but nothing serious.",
        "Really a great deal buying here on Amazon! Expensive box, but got it cheaper here! A large capacity mailbox. Made with materials that will not rust. Mailbox is 22.5 inches deep, so if you buy online, your packages will fit. Very pleased with the way it is made. Excellent deal!",
        "This is a great sized mailbox. The problem is that the door is not easily opened or closed, resulting in the paint chipping at the top of the mailbox due to opening/closing. When not fully shut, the door flaps open.",
        "Our mail carrier insisted and stuffing Prime packages into our small old mailbox until she finally broke the flag off. I had spent too long trying to extricate packages and decided we needed a larger mailbox. This one is very well made and enough bigger. Very pleased with quality, function and design of mailbox.",
        "This is not easily mounted to a 4x4 post. I ended up returning this mailbox and buying the Gibraltar Patriot Large Capacity Rust-Proof mailbox from Amazon. You do NOT need the mount that goes with the Gibraltar Patriot Large Capacity Rust-Proof mailbox. The Gibraltar Patriot Large Capacity Rust-Proof mailbox looks and functions fine.... It took about 5 minutes to install...",
        "I bought this as a gift for a very dear friend. It was absolutely the best size that I could ever had got for her. It is larger then the normal size mailbox. I think it is the perfect size and the cost was just right. And the look has a nice clean black shine. It looks great in front of her house.",
        "Yep...reviews are correct. Unit arrived bent out of shape. Took 15 minutes to bang it back right, but it's serviceable now. If you're looking for perfection, go buy one at the store. This was cheaper and I didn't have to make another run. And you need a board/mount to put it on the post.",
        "Pretty and the perfect size to handle a good many packages. Not huge, not small. We had to get a piece of wood cut for the bottom to stabilize. Gave it four stars because of the needed trouble with wood and because the opening handle came bent.",
        "I do 99% of my shopping online and also sell online. This mailbox is so nice. It's big enough to fit medium size packages and looks sleek in the black color. We put it up in minutes with the matching pound in mailbox pole. And the price is great. You can't go wrong woth this mailbox.",
        "We placed this mailbox on a white post with a white LED light on the top and little white planter on the back. We added big gold numbers on a black background on the post. It's the talk of our neighborhood. (It's a small town.)",
        "The mail box is great. It is a little larger than I had expected, which is perfect. I do a lot of on-line shopping and my old box only will hold a small package. Plus the mail man continually stuffs mail and packages in, then the old box becomes loose from tugging to get the mail out. I cant wait to find the perfect stencils to decorate it.",
        "This oversized mailbox is exactly what we needed!! Amazingly easy to put up and the mail person likes it as well!! Awesome!",
        "We have had this mailbox for a year and a half now, and it is still like new and very attractive. It is large enough for larger packages and flats, but not too large. It's just what we wanted.",
        "It's fine, nothing wrong with it. But Gilbatrar also makes an extra-large size that is enormous and wonderful. I swapped and you should too.",
        "Purchased this altogether with a base post & numbers. This mailbox is pretty cheaply made. The door does not stay shut, so my mail is exposed. Additionally, the flag doesn't stay up. The only good thing about it is it seems pretty heavy duty.",
        "Very happy with the product which was easy to install, once I purchased the screws and numbered label. But....the seller took very good care of me and sent me a small refund for what I spent for the extras. Product was well made and I would certainly recommend this seller.",
        "The mailbox I got but the house you purchased was decrypted so I wanted to make a new one. But thanks anyway as the perfect foundation for my creation. It has stood up beautifully and is a great blank canvas for anyone wanting to customize. I'm also looks sharp in pain white.",
        "This is a good mailbox, especially for the price. The large size is just right for me. I think jumbo is too big, and the regular size only holds the smallest packages. It is sturdily built of fairly heavy steel. I am confident it will provide many years of service unless a snow plow gets it. and if/when a snow plow does get it, I'll be glad I didn't spend more, let alone $100+ for a decorator mail box. I will buy another."
