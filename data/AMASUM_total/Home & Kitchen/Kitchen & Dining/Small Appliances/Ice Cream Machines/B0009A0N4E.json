        "Bought this in Feb 2017, it died within a month. Got a free warranty replacement from Hamilton Beach, it died in 8 months. Usage was only once or twice a month. Both failed the same way. Starts making a grinding noise, then stops churning, the motor continues to runs. Did some investigation,hoping for an easy fix. I found the gears inside stripped. They are metal gears, but the teeth break under the load. The gears look large enough, so I suspect cheap manufacturing methods. They are using a poor quality / cheap steel which does not last. Too bad, works nice while it lasted.",
        "It started getting noisy after 5 batches and completely died after around the 10th batch. I suppose I got my money's worth but do some research, save your money and buy a well-built machine or buy one of these every 4-5 months. It worked good while it lasted.",
        "The ice cream was supreme. My late grandma’s recipe is one of a kind but I was only able to enjoy it 4-5 times before it broke. The lid to the ice cream container never sat completely flat. Too tight. It was hard to completely lock the container in place. Would take several tries of repositioning. It eventually stopped churning the ice cream. Wouldn’t spin. Ended up throwing the whole unit away.",
        "I bought this two months ago and it's already broken. In the middle of a batch the motor started to make an extremely loud clunking noise and the paddle would no longer spin. I didn't expect it to last forever but longer than this.",
        "Item worked great the first time with a very small batch. started noticing water but thought it was sweat. Tried a big batch at school science fair. Unit stopped spinning half way through. had to unplug and wait for it to cool down. luckily it started spinning again and finished the job in about an hour. Water started appearing everywhere. Apparently there was a hole in the bucket. I tried to return or replace item to Amazon who keeps referring me to manufacturer for replacement. If I can't return or replace a product from point of purchase then there is no need to buy it from them.",
        "its fun and easy...so great for making vegan or non dairy ice cream the design is simple and works fine. Do Not allow the blades to get stuck. If this occurs, take off the motor top remove blades and run warm water on the outside of the plastic tub to melt the frozen ice on sides which stop the blades. Using Rock Salt as directed works perfectly but can encourage freezing too fast along the sides or bottom which can stop the blades. Listen for the sound of motor slowing down--or experiment with using less salt when you make a smaller batch..",
        "after less than 2 years (probably used it a dozen times???) the gears that turn the churn have worn out - during the last time we made ice cream I heard the machine start to struggle and the bucket began to have a hard time turning - I took off the plastic cap of the machine and literally there are metal shavings inside the plastic cover and the main gear's teeth are worn to almost nothing - very poor quality",
        "This Camtono is sturdy and easy to run with, easily holds 4 ingots of Beskar. I have spoken.",
        "The spindle is shoddily built. 4 times, it worked fine. The 5th time, it made loud noises and the spindle which holds the mixer stopped spinning. The spindle slips against the motor's shaft hole and stops turning Results: No ice cream, just a cold ice cream mix which had to be refrigerated for it to freeze.. I'm junking this one...and buying an ice cream maker from another manufacturer.",
        "I ordered this ice cream maker last year. The first time we used it the metal components where the paddle fits into the motor malfunctioned. The parts stripped out and left metal shavings on top of our ice cream. There was never any indication that the ice cream was done and the motor never sounded like it was slowing down. I sent two emails to Hamilton Beach complete with and explanation and pictures. I received their automated response saying they received both emails, and then never heard any more. I didn't really think about it much since, until this week and wanting to make ice cream. We are disappointed.",
        "Some reviews mentioned that after a few uses, a component of the ice cream maker would break. This has not been my experience. I got this ice cream maker for my family because we were interested in trying out some homemade ice cream. It was one of the more affordable makers with decent reviews. We are very happy with this product. It makes great ice cream, with a consistancy comparable to soft serve. We use it on a weekly basis, and have been using it for about 3 or 4 months now. It works perfectly! A great entry-level ice cream maker.",
        "This is the freezer I remember from childhood. Easy to use and to clean, works great. However, if you are not familiar with this type of freezer: Stay nearby and listen to the sound of the motor. For approx 30 - 45 mins, all sounds the same, and then in the space of maybe one minute, it starts to freeze up. You NEED ti be there to unplug the machine, otherwise you can burn out the motor. Kinda like if you forget the popcorn in the microwave . . .",
        "Works great , made batch of vanilla bean ice cream 1st time , delicious",
        "Churned my chocolate ice cream for 2.5 hours. Did not freeze.",
        "I absolutely love this ice cream machine. I’ve tried other machines in the past and they were always complicated to operate but this one comes with easy instructions and it’s built very well and within and boxing it I was able to make my first ice cream batch with one of the recipes listed in the booklet that came with the machine. I simply added Oreos to my ice cream and let the machine do the work and that was it. This is a must buy for anyone who loves ice cream but would prefer to add their own toppings I would highly recommend this to anyone.",
        "Did not work out if the box. At all. Now amazon says it’s not eligible for return? Since when? Product support is non existent so now I’m out the $40. The heck with this.",
        "I have had this for months now. The good- it's cheap. Its reliable. It makes delicious ice cream and is fairly easy to use. The bad- it can be tricky to add ice and not make the metal piece float up. We have had to put the metal center (holding the ice cream mix) in, make sure the covers on (so you don't get rock salt in there!) and then put ice in around it. It can be difficult and messy to do this while layering the rock salt. It's worth the price but we think we will stick with the freezer bowl type.",
        "If you don't care about glam and you want to do things the semi-old way, then this churn is for you! Oh my gosh, best homemade ice-cream ever. I made a replica of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream's retired \"Queen City Cayenne\" and this churn pulled it off flawlessly. We were licking the inner canister. It will make huge batches of ice cream. Can't wait to make my grandmother's southern peach ice-cream with the sweet locally grown peaches down the road this upcoming summer! <3",
        "Having used several ice cream makers over the years this one remains my favorite. I had one year ago and decided that I no longer needed it so I let it go (stupid choice) as I then couldn't find one I liked as much and had to buy another one of these. When I had the previous one I would make sorbets and regular ice cream. It always worked great. Now we are on a vegan diet and only make dairy free ice creams. This ice cream maker doesn't disappoint. It's pretty noisy, but worth it. Yum!!",
        "I have a small version of this ice cream maker and found myself needing to make larger amounts when a grandson moved in for the summer. This is easy all the way around. The ice cream is delicious, just add a small amount of simple syrup and xanthan gum to the ice cream recipe and you will have delicious, smooth and easy ice cream. The maker is as great and easy as any I have ever used. Good purchase.",
        "I've only used this once to make a vegan ice cream recipe, because it's expensive and loaded with sugars in stores. I made a banana ice cream, followed the directions, and it came out delicious and perfect! It was the consistency of a nice soft-serve right out of the machine, and I froze it overnight and made milkshakes the next day. So good! I took off a star because of the noise--it's very loud!! Other than that, I am happy I bought it and would suggest to a friend.",
        "I am not sure how I lived so long without owning an ice cream maker. For the most part, I eat clean, and I am lactose intolerant. I really missed ice cream!! While there are many dairy free ice cream, I haven't been able to find any that don't contain additives or sweeteners I prefer not to consume. With this super budget-friendly ice cream machine, however, I am able to make all sorts of diary-free, refined sugar-free, additive free ice cream. It is so easy to use, and easy to clean. It is pretty loud though, so I usually put it in our laundry room when it is churning.",
        "I received the ice cream maker last night. When I got home from work, I immediately made a batch of vanilla ice milk. Super simple: Put 4 cups, 2% milk/1 cup, sugar/1 tsp, vanilla in metal container, stir until sugar dissolves. Then put container in freezer for 1 hour. Set the canister inside the ice cream bucket w/mixer, surround canister with ice and salt and let it run for 30 min. Its LOUD!...but SO worth it! If it doesn't quit on me, this will be one of my BEST buys.",
        "Started with a batch of plain old vanilla (using the recipe included) and I was taken back to my childhood with the AWESOME flavor!!! Shared a big container of it with my neighbors and the next day they knocked on the door to insist on getting the recipe and the name brand & source of where I purchased the ice cream churn! 🍦😋Great Buy!!",
        "I got this for Christmas and loved it. Easy to use, but takes about an entire bag of ice to fill the inside of the maker. I usually just keep the metal bowl in the freezer so it’s already frozen when I go to make ice cream. It is noisy but I have heard louder ones. It also only takes about 20 minutes or less to make a double batch and it’s really creamy when done! Definitely recommend",
        "Loving this! It's old-school...so no chance of weird fluid leaking out of the seams like in my last one, the kind that had to go in the freezer. The only down side to this one is the quality of the metal canister - it's very thin metal, it bends very easily, and in fact it arrived bent. It was too much work to return it, so we kept it since it still functioned OK, but since it was a gift for my daughter I was pretty disappointed in that part. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Have made several batches of very good ice cream!",
        "I used this product to make gelato about every two weeks. My recipes are usually small, around 4 cups, and this machine is supposedly designed to mix twice that much. The motor was very loud right from the start, but so was my old, old, old ice cream maker. Also, after churning, at the bottom of the metal container some of the cream was almost frozen to the bottom and sides. I don't think the inside beater has been designed to move all the cream uniformly. I was very surprised when the motor gave out after only 6 months.",
        "The design and operation of the unit is fine. (Made two batches so far.) My only concern is durability, which I can’t address other than to say its a plastic unit with a thin wall aluminum canister. Its not a quiet unit, but not overly loud either. I try to be gentle with it in the hopes that I can maximize its life. You get what you pay for definitely applies to this unit. I didn’t pay much for this unit so I don’t expect it to last 20 years like my old ice cream maker. Next time, I’ll probably go for a high end White Mountain product.",
        "After 50 minutes and 15 pounds of crushed ice and 9 cups of rock salt, this machine produced a thin milkshake consistency ice cream.. Do not buy this Ice Cream Maker. I returned it immediately.",
        "Loved this until the third batch of ice cream then I guess the paddle stopped turning because it kept running until I was afraid it would burn the motor out. The only thing frozen was the walls of the rub. Would not buy again. Pay a bit more and hopefully get one that will work longer",
        "From my experience, all ice cream freezers are pretty much created equally. This one is no different. It works just like all of those fancy wooden bucket ones, so why spend more? Handy tip: use pellet style ice (like the ice you get in your delicious Sonic beverages). It packs tighter and that makes the ice cream freeze faster. The faster the ice cream freezes the creamier the texture.",
        "This Hamilton Beach Ice Cream Maker is amazing! I just bought one for personal use, but I have been using these to mass produce ice cream for a few years now. Ice cream churns extremely well and thickens up after being in the freezer overnight. It comes with many great recipes tailored just for the machine! I tried the Cookies and Cream recipe that came in the manual and it turned out perfect! Other reviews state that it stops working within a couple months of use. We’ll see! But so far so good!",
        "Purchased ice cream freezer on April 3,2020, used 3 times and motor quit. Will not turn. Hamilton Beach will not answer the telephone. Form to replace does not work and you can not e-mail. What in the world is going on. Please contact me at 252-469-4586",
        "I simply cannot believe that I waited so long to get one of these. I'm beyond happy with this ice cream maker, it works as intended and makes such a delicious treat, better than any store-bought ice cream. I am obsessed with it. THIS is far better than sliced bread, or the wheel, or the invention of Fire. Did I mention I'm obsessed with this? If you've been on the fence about buying one of these, jump over, you won't be disappointed.",
        "Makes wonderful ice cream! Make different flavors by adding your own (cookies, candies, fruits, etc). You will need containers for the homemade ice cream to place in the freezer. Only drawback for me --- it is kinda noisy when it's \"churning\" but isn't it fun!?!",
        "I am from a very rural area and making homemade ice cream was a fun family event. Now that I live in a more urban area and have kids of my own, I wanted to share that with them. I purchased this ice cream maker and am very pleased. My kids love helping make ice cream and it tastes great. Price wise this was a cheap maker but it seems to have good quality. I have used it 3-4 times now and would highly recommend it.",
        "This was a great treat for my family! We had one similar that broke but this one has stood up to all the ice cream we've made! It arrived quickly and was exactly what we were hoping it would be! This machine came with an amazing recipe for \"old fashioned vanilla\" and it's AMAZING! Following the directions and making it from scratch it turned out so velvety soft, and chilled just right. It made a family BBQ tradition continue and will keep going for several years to come!",
        "After looking at the recipe book and instructions, realized it is not as simple as we had hoped for the kids and appears after buying all ingredients, a gallon will cost about $15,00, Still in box new, wish I could return or exchange it. Should not have held it so long before opening. Hamilton Beach, what can you do for me?",
        "Made 2 batches so far from the provided recipes. Machine works great and it is easy to use. Make sure you follow all the prep instructions (having everything chilled ahead of time). Of my 2 batches, the first \"old fashioned vanilla\" was not to my liking because I don't like custard - but my sisters found it amazing. Tried out the \"easy vanilla\" recipe and that was more what I had been expecting. The better ingredients you use, the better it turns out!",
        "This ice cream maker is awesome and so easy to use! We use the recipes that come with it and only make some minor changes for the creamiest ice cream ever! We have received a lot of compliments on our ice cream and we have made it many times for friends and family! So we have really used this machine in the time we have had it. I would definitely buy it again and actually a few friends have bought it after seeing what we do with it!!",
        "Makes good ice cream as any other maker. My only complaint is the cord is super short, like a foot long, and the thin metal container has a dent in it. It also makes a lot of noise. It's also a time consuming, messy and not so cheap process. (Not the fault of the product). So, if throwing a container of Edy's or Breyers into the cart is too pedestrian for you, have at it.",
        "This unit is very easy to use. I used a premade mix (way easier than the recipes provided) it turned out really well! Although the unit is extremely LOUD, it makes ice cream really well.",
        "Used this to make homemade chocolate frosties. It was easy and quick. Comes with a recipe guide but I have only used a recipe from google so far. A word of advice: When using this machine, assemble, add ingredients, and turn on BEFORE adding the rock salt and ice. This is in the directions but I chose to do it the hard way. I learned my lesson.",
        "Very excited to start making ice cream for my husband, he loves weird flavors and stuff in ice cream. This allows me to make strange stuff like bread pudding ice cream with honey roasted almonds lol Can't find that in the crocery store, not tp mention I can have seasonal favorites anytime.",
        "Purchased this as old one motor stopped we had ice cream ready to mix so instead of wasting it, placed in the refrigerator ordered new one and 2 days later we made ice cream. Works very well and churns fast.",
        "Had a churn as a child, but this one is so easy to operate. Also THE RECIPE BOOK HAS THE BEST RECIPE FOR ICE CREAM, YOU CAN IMAGINE. Followed the directions and when I made Aztecs ice cream, I was definitely the hit of the party. Azetcs has a hint of hot pepper and chocolate in the recipe .",
        "This was the first ice cream maker I have ever purchased so have nothing to compare it to. That being said, I love it! Very, very easy to use and very easy to clean up. Runs perfectly and the ice cream I've made so far has turned out wonderful every time. Makes a lot of ice cream also!",
        "This little thing is great at making ice cream. It is simple to use and cleans up well. Keep enough salt and ice in the side and the ice cream will set up pretty thick. Made for great root beer floats",
        "I've made ice cream several times now using their recipe book and ones I've found online. Each time, it comes out creamy, delicious and perfect. Parts are easy to clean.",
        "Sent to my parents for my nieces/nephews. Let them enjoy the excitement of making their own ice cream and have those memories.",
        "I bought this ice cream maker for my wife for a birthday present. Everyone seems to recommend a much more expensive maker, which is out of our budget for the time being. We decided to give this one a shot. It works very well, making some good tasting ice cream. I can't speak to the longevity of the machine, since we've only had it a couple of months, but it seems to be well worth the price we paid for it. This is a machine that will make some good ice cream, and you can get it for a fraction of the cost of the name brand makers. Well worth it!",
        "Good product, a little bit more noisy than I expected. The packaging was unacceptable when it arrived (see photos).",
        "I really wanted to like this ice cream maker but there are others that are so much better and don't require as much ice (10 pounds) and no rock salt. It really is just too much of a hassle to work with this one. Go with another that has a bowl you can place in the freezer instead of having to use 10 pounds of ice.",
        "Never got to taste anything. Motor on this thing was not strong enough to keep the thing running just as the cream started to freeze to the sides of the can. Just stopped running. Tried it twice. Did the same thing. Just too cheaply made to do the job.",
        "My family has made homemade ice cream for family events all my life we started out with a handcrank and as I've gotten older I've learned appreciate the use and ease of an electric freezer yes they can be noisy but that's part of the charm a good tip is to put the candy in the paddle in the freezer to chill for about 15 minutes and to make sure all your ingredients are cold before you start you will be amazed at the taste of homemade ice cream compared to what you can get in the store",
        "This Is a great ice cream maker! Many recipes, quality machine! The only complaint I have is that it is SO LOUD. I suppose it would be nice if it stored easier. I can get it into a nice spot but it doesn't really all fit into the bucket so I just latch the motor on as in operation. Otherwise it doesn't take that long - 20-30 minutes. And it's pretty yummy stuff! We have mostly used it in the winter and then we set the thing right outside in a snowbank to harden (we have a small freezer).",
        "Used several times now and it works well. A little noisy, and have to put on counter top because plug is not very long. So it can get messy putting in the salt. But great price.",
        "This might be a great product but for me it was the wrong size. It hasn't even been opened and I am unable to return it. So be 100% sure its the one you want before buying.",
        "We bought this for Christmas and made ice cream for New Year's Eve and it was great! We made the cookies & cream recipe in the book and it was a huge crowd pleaser, and people even brought leftover ice cream home because we had some leftover from 1 batch. It's a little noisy, but not too bad; we were still able to watch movies and have the ice cream maker going and not wake up my son in the next room. We are excited to try some Sorbet next!",
        "I got this for my daughter for christmas after I returned the von chef one, no matter how hard she tried on the von chef on, it never made ice cream, just more like a cold pudding texture. She says this is perfect and I have tasted the ice cream, it IS excellent. Just like when I was a kid but we had to turn the crank by hand, good thing there were alot of us kids back then!",
        "This makes great ice cream, relatively easy. My only complaint is that it is quite loud, so I couldn't use it during nap time (which was usually the only time I had enough time to make up a batch). It stores nicely (I flipped the top piece upsidedown into the bucket and put it on my shelf in the garage), and it makes ice cream pretty quickly. It's definitely easy to use, but the noise is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.",
        "We've used this to make many batches of peanut butter ice cream. Does an excellent job, but is a little noisy, so we keep it in another room while it's churning.",
        "Worked great, even when doing a full gallon. I just wish someone could create an ice cream maker that was reasonable quite. I couldn't use it in my kitchen as it is deafening. I put it in a room down the hall, closed the door, and still had to increase the volume on the TV.",
        "I haven't been able to made some good ice cream that holds yet but the machine still works so i have hope. Good price too.",
        "After searching all over Steamboat Springs for an ice cream maker and not having any luck, I ordered this for a friends birthday We had homemade ice cream the next day. Yummy",
        "I have not had an opportunity to use this yet. But I was very surprised that it was shipped in its shelf box without any additional padding. In addition, the bottom container is just a large thin plastic container. Not what I expected having owned ice cream makers in the past.",
        "After 20 minutes of use, the motor quite during the ice cream unit. It the motor continued to run but wouldn't turn the turn. There was something that broke inside as I could hear a rattling noise, like a nut or piece of the unit snapped off. Beyond the Amazon return policy, In process of working with Hamilton Beach warranty process.",
        "Right out of the box the motor hummed but would not spin. My husband and I had to take the top off of the motor and push the propeller to restart the motor several times. It made for a poor showing on the 4th of July while hosting family and friends.",
        "Love it. It’s like old times again, using an old recipe!",
        "I love ice cream and I love this ice cream maker. It is very very loud though so when we turn it on we put it in the laundry room which is in between the garage and kitchen. Makes plenty of ice cream (in my opinion) and is easy to clean. The only cons are the noise as previously mentioned and the fact that it is a little bulky. Neither are that big of a problem for me though. I would definitely buy again.",
        "i wish the electrical cord was a little longer. Other than that no problems. Worked like a champ. I am very happy with this ice cream maker.",
        "Have made 2 recipes in it. One with eggs and one without. Works great!! There is enough space between freezer and the inner can that a good wall of ice/salt can occur. Motor works well and grinds to a halt when ice cream is soft enough to still add what ever you want to add. Be sure to allocate the ~4 hours to \"harden\" However, most people will eat the ice cream even if not hardened!!! Ben",
        "We have a house far away from the grocery store. We never get ice cream home before it melts. Problem solved. Already made one batch of pistachio and it was delicious.",
        "Made delicious peach ice cream from recipe that came with it. Cord is too short for me to use on my island sink. Appears it is designed to use in a sink against a backslash with a very close outlet. I used an extension cord.",
        "Bought this as a present for my daughter. She really likes ice cream :) So far we've made about 5 batches and it has worked very well. The only negative is the noise. Consistent results when following the recipes.",
        "This product works just as I would expect it to. We have made probably 5 ice-creams/frozen yogurts with it within a month's span and it has held up great. We washed the canister in the dishwasher and it became discolored but didn't seem to break down. I would suggest hand washing the components. The only issue I have with this product is the power cord to the electric motor is only about 2 feet long and the whole machine has to be strategically placed to make sure that ice/water/salt overflow doesn't get on anything important.",
        "Forget all those kitchen countertop gadgets. This is what you're after. A+",
        "So my husband spent a small fortune on real black walnut flavoring along with others and I just knew his attempt to make sugar free ice cream was going to be a costly bust. I was very wrong. The ice cream was delicious and this ice cream maker made it easy for him to make ice cream. I was very pleased with the outcome and I am ready for him to make some more.",
        "This is my second machine. The first one lasted about 8 years. we make home-made Ice Cream on a regular basis and this little machine does a great job. It has a gallon capacity so unlike most of the machines, you can have friends over and still have plenty to go around. we make about 40 gallons a year and these machines hold up well.",
        "Ice cream got so hard around the edge but not in the middle. I think the medal middle part is stripped. I am disappointed in this ice cream maker. The top keeps turning even tho the paddle on the inside no longer turns .",
        "Cheap, First the \"bucket\" is so lightweight I was worried it would break. One other issue, is the way the motor is mounted to the bucket, because the bucket is so flimsy, motor does not lock to well. This product is OK, if you only make a few gallon once in awhile, but you need or want to make more, look for a better built product.",
        "Doesn't make a bunch of noise. I don't like the paddle because the small pieces of fruit hang up on it. The old style worked so much better--a long blade with very little dividers. Because of the design of paddle fruit doesn't disperse through the ice cream. I do not know if I would purchase another, because it will depend on how long this one last. I've made fresh peach and strawberry cream.",
        "Bought it for my husband, works great and ice-cream is even better than store bought.",
        "Product works well. ..we've made delicious ice cream over these warm days. The only thing is its loud.",
        "It is quite noisy, but it works perfectly fine. I've used it twice and so far good results, even with only using a half recipe as 4 quarts seemed overkill for just two of us. Just a note: if you don't use a full recipe, the motor will NOT shut off when done. I checked it after 30 minutes and it was done. Just remember that the ice cream is going to be more like soft-serve and you need to freeze it for a while if you want it harder.",
        "Making ice cream is a PROJECT, but it is really delicious. This ice cream maker is still going strong 3 years, and many batches, later. We have really had some great ice cream.",
        "this hamilton beach ice cream maker is working just fine and we have used it several time thus far.there is 1 thing i have found and that is the aluminum mixing pot/tank/tub is not heavy gauge and can bend out of shape if handled roughly.but for the money it is a very nice product.remember to use plenty of ice and salt and if you have the maker working,prepare 2 batches as it will use the ice/salt and justify the clean-up.why a mess for just 1 gal.?sometimes we make 2 or 3 and mix motor has yet to over-heat.",
        "Worked great for about a couple months of weekly use. Yesterday it stopped. I'd say get something else.",
        "Love this ice cream maker. Make sure to use the correct ice to salt ratio. There are complaints about the noise but I think it’s fine.",
        "Nice machine. Noise is what I expected it to be. Like the plastic tube for eliminating leaking and corrosion on the outer tube. The metal tank for the ice cream itself seems heavy enough to last a long time. I replace an ice cream maker that was at least 15 years old and I think this will last as long. I wish they made a five Qt unit of this style. I could not find one if they do.",
        "I would have given it more stars except that the cord is incredibly short. And yet the ice cream maker has to sit inside the sink while it's working so that the melting ice can drain out. You can't just move the machine near a plug. If you're lucky enough to have a plug right next to the sink then you're good. But I had to use an extension cord which was cumbersome & inconvenient in my kitchen. It works great though!",
        "Love this maker, I have bought the high dollar ones in the past and this one works just as good",
        "After making ice cream with my grandpa growing up this was an item that I knew that I had to get as an adult. After ordering I received it very fast along with my old-fashioned ice cream recipe book. It was very easy to set up and the ice cream was fantastic. I would recommend this to anybody starting out in the ice cream making field!",
        "My family and I LOVE this machine! We have used it for a while and have went through several batches of ice cream with it. They have all turned out delicious. We use the recipes and instructions it came with very thoroughly to make sure everything comes out perfect!",
        "First go around the ice cream took forever to make. That was my fault since I did not chill the cream mix and use enough ice/salt. The next batch I stuck in the freezer for an hour before mixing so it was ice cold. I then used plenty of ice and salt and reapplied about every 15 minutes as needed. Took about 45-55 minutes and came out great. Can't wait to try more flavors.",
        "We bought this to make our own vegan ice cream. Its so easy and fast with this ice cream maker. We love that you can plug it in and just let it go as it will turn off automatically when it is done.",
        "I dislike the fact that this item is non refundable. People look close at what your buying before you buy especially now. I now have an item I do not want but cannot return it. Only buy if there is option to return.",
        "I bought this with the intention of making ice cream ALL the time. I've used it once. It's incredibly easy to use, however. And I'm glad that I can technically make multiple batches a day so long as I have easy access to ice, rather than having to wait 24 hours for the kind that require pre-freezing.",
        "Everything was perfect! It makes ice cream fast, and it’s easy to clean. It’s a bit loud, but well worth it.",
        "I LOVE my new ice cream maker! I had another brand that used a frozen bowl but it was never frozen long enough to make good ice cream. This one is fantastic. Would replace in a heartbeat with the same one or would proudly gift one to someone for a wedding gift, Christmas gift, etc."
