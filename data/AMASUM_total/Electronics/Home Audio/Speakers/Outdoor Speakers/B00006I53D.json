        "Great speakers but after a year one sounded like an internal speaker had gone out. Spoke with Bose to find out this was manufactured in 2008 even though I bought it in 2018. Bose is going to repair because I have a receipt and then only offer a year warranty. Do not buy on Amazon if you want a new speaker set. Iâ€™m questioning how long these are going to last since they are already 10 years old.",
        "The sound is terrific. Don't let the term \"wireless\" let you think there are no wires. You have to connect the speakers to an amplifier via speaker wire and plug in the amp to an electrical outlet. The recommended amp is for indoor use only so I had to drill a hole in my house to run the 2 wires from indoors where I plugged in the amp to the 2 speakers outdoors. Once installed, playing the speakers via a Bluetooth connection is a breeze. A tip is to be sure you have good wireless connection near the speakers too.",
        "I am a musician and a nut about sound quality. After lots of research I chose the Bose 251 Wall Mount Outdoor Environmental Speakers to hang on the back of my house. I already had wiring in place which made installation easier. You need to drill holes in the wall for the plastic screw anchors, then hang the mounts with the screws, hang the speakers and crank it up! The sound is as good as you are going to get in an outdoor setting. The bass is very good and you can dial the volume up to call the police levels. Highly recommended.",
        "They are much bigger than I expected, and don't put off near the amount of sound as I thought they would considering their size. There's not a lot of options out there for outdoor speakers so I decided to go with these since they had great reviews and they are BOSE after all. Wish I would've tested some other brands now before purchasing these.",
        "purchased these speakers in may of 2014 to use as deck speakers on my commercial fishing boat in Bristol bay Alaska. They are used for the 2 month season 20 hours a day. they are clear and without distortion at the very high volume needed to be heard over the hydraulics and engines when the boat is running and clear at a low volume when boat is at anchor. they are mounted where they take continual salt water spray and have held up well.",
        "I replaced my former blown out speakers with these and I am glad I spent the extra money to get these. Well worth it. Work perfectly, great sound, easy install. Have maintained look, sound, and quality since being outside, in the weather, for 4+ months.",
        "Great speakers. It's work to install them. Hire someone who knows. You need to buy the BOSE amp in order to make them work. The speakers are great but the am doesn't recognize our music from our computer. My husband called Bose and it seems that the software they are using is poor. It's disappointing considering the total price between the speakers and the amp. Hopefully it will get resolved.",
        "These are some of the best speakers on the planet!! I use them in my professional DJ business (with a subwoofer), at community functions, and in my Boy Scout activities. They made my back patio the most desirable room (in) the home, and when I recently sold the home, the buyer put in the contract that I would leave the Bose outdoor speakers! Easy enough, I just purchased a brand-new set for my current home!! Everyone is happy!!",
        "They really look good on the front and back of the house and then I have them hooked to a Sonos Device. They're waterproof weatherproof and they sound really good if you have a low volume settings or a high volume settings! I love BOSE Products they're all over the house and now they're on the outside!",
        "LOVE these speakers, my second pair. Great sound, easy install, easy speaker removal and storage before vacations, and again great sound. Read and follow the directions especially when it addresses distances. However, they do require a bit more power than most other outdoor speakers. Recommend this product.",
        "OMG!! The best sounding speakers I have ever owned! And yes, I have other Bose speakers but these are a step above in clarity and sound. I don't even have a sub woofer and they are so good. You wouldn't believe the little 50 amp amplifier I have them attached to either. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida has never sounded so good...",
        "Bose 251s are Excellent! I did a TON of research and finally chose these. On my patio I needed my sound to turn the corner and with their angled speakers they sound amazing all over my patio. Great value for money.",
        "Very nice speakers however the warranty has already expired even though I just bought these on May 4 and they were delivered last week. There is supposed to be a 5 year warranty. Not sure what kind if scam is happening here. Very disappointed.",
        "I researched long and hard for the perfect pair of outdoor speakers for my patio area. I read many reviews and settled upon this pair of Bose 251's. I must say, I'm extremely happy with the decision. I have a large patio and backyard area ... and this pair of speakers is certainly up to the task. They fill my yard perfectly with Bose perfection. They have, so far, weathered some harsh weather and still look and sound brand-new!! An excellent addition to my home!",
        "I purchased 2 of these sets about two weeks ago (July 2020), installed it right the way but only today entered registration info on Bose website. Both of them after registration state \"No longer in warranty\". Otherwise great speakers. I wish it had better bass when on lower volume though",
        "Installed a pair at each end of my patio and they sound fantastic. Full, clear sound that gets fuller and deeper as you increase the volume. Highly recommended.",
        "Love these. Installed on my back patio. I use them for listening to music and for watching movies on the padio during the grandkids visits.",
        "I wish they would have told you you need Banana Plugs. Then the installation would have been extremely easy. The sound is so amazing!! I wish I would have ordered them years ago!",
        "They sound amazing and have great bass for being outdoors. Would buy again.",
        "these speakers are awesome - clear, good bass and will blow you out outside. excellent buy for the money.",
        "Really disappointed by Bose. Supposed to be their flagship outdoor speakers. But terrible quality and cannot hold any base. Was trying to replace my amplifier as well, thinking it might be the problem. But same thing. Will try JBL next.",
        "WOW. These speakers really rock. They are very heavy which lets you know that the quality is there in the material. Bigger than I expected. They sound incredible. Expensive but you get what you pay for.",
        "These sound amazing. Extremely loud if you need them to be while still sounding incredible. Would highly recommend.",
        "I was informed by BOSE that the speakers I ordered via Amazon.com were from 2014. I was sold 4 year old speakers with apparently no warranty. Both speakers did not work on arrival.",
        "Appears to be very well made and prepared to take on the elements. Sound is typical Bose .... great! Thrilling Audio was supplier. They did a great job with order. Arrived on time and quickly!",
        "They are simply amazing!!! I have four of these coupled with 2 eight inch in-ground Bose speakers and the sound is beyond unbelievable!",
        "Been a Bose user for many years. Had a pair of these speakers for over 12 years and still work great. Just added a second pair to the patio and wow. Had a problem with one of the older ones and Bose was great with the repair.",
        "This is the second set of these that we have bought. Exactly as advertised.",
        "We had been looking for outdoor speakers for a patio. Had tried multiple versions of wireless speakers, but never got good sound, or distance. We had been shopping for weeks and were getting ready to purchase a set of speakers that were more than twice as expensive. Was able to get a sample of these next to the more expensive speakers, and could not tell the difference. Installation was easy, simnply had to snake the speaker wires down the wall and out to the porch.",
        "I can't say enough good things about these outdoor speakers!! The quality was beyond our expectations. We can crank them up and feel like we're \"club Vegas\" without losing quality of sound! Really love them. They're crowd pleasing for sure!",
        "Phenomenal sound, good base, mid and highs at all decibels. Installed them before finishing the job...makes work a little easier.",
        "Sounds great...only outdoor solution that i trust to last years and years.",
        "These speakers replaced 2 older Bose outdoor speakers in the same place, so installing was a snap and the speakers preform flawlessly. The only minor problem that I came across was that the volume would get down to about 50% for a couple of seconds and then go back. I do not know if this is because of the speakers or because of the wiring. I do not think it is the speakers tho, and it doesn't happen that often so i would still recommend this product.",
        "Bose has done a great job with these speakers. I have a 1 acre lot and the back yard is filled with amazing clear sound. I have them hooked up to a dedicated Amp that is connected to a Denon pre-amp and they perform fantastically.",
        "I have two of these mounted on the side of my garage about 30' apart and 9' high. They are driven by a 1980's harman kardon receiver connected to a bluetooth receiver.. They fill the area with great sound. I will have to wait and see how they hold up to the elements but so far they are excellent.",
        "Great sound. I bought these for our boat. I now have 3 pairs of Bose speakers on the boat and they sound great.",
        "I bought these to go in my shop. I have a pioneer system in there now, but I give Bose just as much credit for sound as I do Pioneer. They work really well along with the two Pioneer speakers I have. If you love to hear music.....you wanna hear it good. Yeah, I would recommend these.",
        "I had Bose speakers for 25 years and finally one of them stop working. I decided to stay with a product that lasted so long on my outdoor patio.",
        "Just phenomenal speakers, u hear every aspect of the song youâ€™re listening to. They r directional too, your neighbors wonâ€™t complain when youâ€™re cranking the tunes.",
        "Just perfect. Crisp clear sound. I have this connected to my Bose SA-4 amplifier.",
        "The Best Sound Durable. Easy to set up. Highly Recommend",
        "Awesome sound as what to expect with Bose technology. I would have bought them in black, but they were a gift for my boyfriends patio deck. He wanted white!",
        "Dynamite speakers outside our pool ... plenty of volume and clear sound.",
        "These speakers offer very good sound quality. My patio area is large, and these speakers fill the entire area with sound. I do think that having four would be ideal so that you wouldn't have to turn up the volume so high, but all in all they sound great.",
        "Outstanding outdoor speakers. Solid, great sound. I've tried others but these are by far the best!",
        "I have listened to them all. These provide the richest, thickest, most diverse quality of sound I have heard in outdoor speakers. Have been very satisfied!",
        "amazing speakers. I was a skeptic, but they really are amazing. Loud + crystal clear at the same time. I am impressed.",
        "great speaker, no problem setting up. tried to set up with a cheaper speaker and the bose blew it away. had to purchase second pair in order to have a balanced listening experience. Nothing but positive comments from others.",
        "If youâ€™re looking for great outdoor speakers, these are the ones for you.",
        "These speakers are awesome for the outdoors. They also feature a lovely low end which makes the sound feel more rounded.",
        "This product was compared to the Bose 151, by far, it is superior in sound quality! Without doubt, I am glad that I payed the extra $100, and took the time to exchange the 151's. Both speakers were very easy to install, less than 30 mins.",
        "What can I say. AWESOME!!!! Sound, looks and ease of setting up. So stoked I bought these. The sound travels far into my 1/2 acre property.",
        "Just attached 4 of these speakers to the rear of our home and couldn't be happier. Crystal clear sound and they look great on our home. I found them to have PLENTY of low end (bass) and would recommend these speakers to anyone. I am VERY picky when it comes to sound and I am completely satisfied with this purchase.",
        "look very nice, install was a breeze and they sound good... I wish the bass was a little deeper, but I have to remember that listening to audio indoors and outdoors is a different...",
        "Amazing sound quality. Installed with a Sonos Amp and work amazingly well.",
        "they are expensive, but they are very well made and were the perfect fit for my backyard. five stars if the price was better",
        "Worth every penny, can't go wrong with Bose ! Hung these today cranked them up and was not disappointed!",
        "Not a ton of bass but they sound have a nice sound. They last a long time too. My dad has had a pair of these for over 10 years and they are still going strong.",
        "I would recommended these speakers to anyone looking for extra quality sound",
        "Exactly what you would expect from Bose. Good deep sounds, holds up to weather. Good sound distribution.",
        "This is probably my tenth pair of Bose speakers. I have bookshelf and ceiling speakers installed throughout the house and this is my second pair of outdoor speakers. The tone, base, quality, and looks are all great.",
        "First set was bad but super easy return process and we are in business!",
        "The sound is amazing. I wish the speakers were able to turn so you could adjust them and face them whatever direction you wanted.",
        "these speakers don't put out the sound that I had expected from a high end Bose speaker.",
        "Not the best sound for the money. Week lows and basic sound",
        "The best speakers for outdoor. I have 4 in my balcony and the sound is perfect",
        "Love these speakers!! Ours are mounted outside on a covered patio approximately 10' apart and 8' high and are connected to a Sonos Connect Amp. Sound fills our back yard and the bass is surprisingly resonant (not booming, but satisfying). The small amp drives the speakers distortion-free up to max volume (which is louder than we would ever need them). Easy install, great mounting system, highly recommended.",
        "sound great for outside PA and stereo at our company auto shop. Came quick and had no issue with packaging.",
        "Love the Bose speakers. We have them mounted outside and they are great!",
        "These are an upgrade from a cheap pair from Best Buy ($100) and blast them away. They sound much fuller, even at lower volumes.",
        "Great speakers. Even at a pretty low volume the sound quality carries pretty far. These are a good long term investment.",
        "I bought these and paired them with a set of Bose 51 Free Space speakers, a Bose SoundTouch SA-5 amp, and a Niles GSS10 subwoofer. My backyard rocks! The system sounds great around the pool and has plenty of power to irritate the neighbors. I definitely recommend a subwoofer - it makes a world of difference. These speakers are loud, clear, and super easy to install. I highly recommend them!",
        "Speakers came few days before expected. Sealed box with nothing wrong. Looks brand new. Perform perfect. Very happy with the purchase.",
        "These speakers met my expectations as I already had two existing pairs of the same brand and model number in my yard.",
        "These speaker where purchase to put outside and they were very easy to install and have a very nice sound.",
        "These speakers sound amazing. Quality of these things feels high.",
        "I am using these as the rear speakers for the surround sound out on my deck. They have good sound, good base, but the Polk Audio Atrium system with the subwoofer sounded better so I use that as the front speakers and subwoofer.",
        "Bought these to replace a set of 6 year old yamaha aw350 outdoor speakers that were looking quite worn. These cost 3 times as much, and only sound a bit better. The Bose have a much wider \"sweet spot\" than the Yamahas, which is nice, but $200 in my pocket is a sweeter spot.",
        "Great speakers purchased two sets to go with sony wifi receiver ! Amazed by quality!",
        "Easy to install when coupled with the SA-3 amplifier and the Personal Music Center III remote control from Bose. Great sound for my patio.",
        "Excellent speakers. Stereo separation in my back yard is great. I love Bose",
        "Best all around speakers you can get and amazing sound. Bose speakers are unique and althoug the price of the speakers are not cheap,the quality is outstanding!",
        "I need to say up front I love Bose stuff, which is why I shelled out $400.00 for these speakers hoping they would blow me away. Well, my 8 year old Yamaha 150's sounded as good, and better on the higher range, than these Bose 251's. So I ended up returning them. There simply was no advantage in replacing the Yamaha's with these speakers. Trust me, I wish they were great, but they fell flat.",
        "I bought these for my deck and they sound wonderful. I have no complaints. The sound nice, they were easy to mount, and they work out of the box. You definitely get more than you paid for in my opinion. I am no audiophile, but I like being on my deck.",
        "The Bose 251 speakers have great quality sound. They sound great around our pool. Easy to install and easy to remove for the winter if you want to.",
        "Horrible. Worse sound. Started rattling right away. Sounds like tin cans. I called Bose and they weren't much help at all. Real disappointment. I now have to buy replacement speakers..........Man I'm really upset",
        "I'm a girl and I don't know much about buying speakers, but these Bose outdoor speakers are off the chain. I purchased these and had them hung in August under my patio cover. You gotta love them!!",
        "These speakers are awesome. They sound great!! I recommend these speakers to anyone who's looking for outdoor speakers. I love them!",
        "After hearing the Bose 251's at sporting events such as baseball games and realizing that they stay unprotected from the weather, even hurricanes, I purchased a set for my patio area. I can say now that I will not be disappointed as I have been in the past with other speakers. They have a clean, crisp sound even at lower volume levels when sitting out on the patio with friends. The neighbors even enjoy them when we are outside working in the yard and we have the volume turned up.",
        "Overall, a great, well rounded pair of outdoor speakers. Frequency response tested as ~40Hz-15kHz. I do find that the Twiddler design does make for great mid-ranges and reasonable bass, but lacks some definition. Nice aesthetic but wish that mounts allowed for up/down and left/right for better positioning. Easy to install, and project well. Upgrade from Sonance Mariner speakers and their range is slightly better and project further.",
        "I replaced my JBL Studio speakers with the Bose 251 and heard such a big difference in sound and clarity. You can't go wrong buying these speakers.",
        "The low and mids sound incredible but they are seriously lacking in base. The amp they are hooked up to easily causes distortion at mid to loud volume... I turn the base off all together and it sounds incredible, but they do lack that \"thump\". Normal folks wont notice this... I'm an audiophile and nit pick everything... I just think for the cost that they should have a better sub sound.",
        "Sound amazing, and so far have really held up to the weather well. I will say you get a lot of rear projections, so if you need the area behind the speakers to not receive too much of the sound then this set might not be right for you.",
        "I took the advice from the \"most helpful critical review\" and purchased the Yamaha NS-AW350 speakers. While they sound marginally ok indoors, they sounded a little pathetic in my large back yard. After living with inferior sound for a couple of years, I just upgraded to the Bose 251. Wow! There is a world of difference. From a full, rich base to crystal clear cymbals, the sound is simply amazing. And just for grins, I brought the 251's back indoors and compared them to my ridiculously expensive JBL's. To me, the 251's sounded better. These are terrific speakers and well worth the money.",
        "Awesome speakers! it was an easy install. It works well in my patio with the pool. I recently had a pool party and it worked well beyond my expectations. I was originally looking at the 151's until I started reading the reviews and came across the 251's. It is loud and crisp, the sound goes well beyond the pool enclosure and into the yard. I'm very pleased with Bose and I'm happy with my purchase. I highly recommend!!",
        "Great sound. Very nice look. It has been outside now for few months but no fading of color",
        "I knew I would not be disappointed with Bose speakers and totally stand by this brand. I installed them in my garage to make working there more agreeable and they deliver fine sound. Installation was easy and they sound great.",
        "Very clear sound, very neat, but no bass, not deep. Need a Subwoofer.",
        "The speakers seem to lack lower end a little but I may not be driving them with enough wattage.",
        "Awesome !! Simple awesome. I now have four of them. Two on my upper deck. And now two by the pool. Love the sound ..."
