Missed every 3rd or 4th letter typed. Good build quality but lacks Mac-specific keys like EJECT. Not Apple compliant, lacking proper meta key layout. Has a good feel but wireless connection is temperamental. Design is not suitable for small hands. Does not work well with overhead lighting due to glare. Spacebar often does not register when pressed.",
