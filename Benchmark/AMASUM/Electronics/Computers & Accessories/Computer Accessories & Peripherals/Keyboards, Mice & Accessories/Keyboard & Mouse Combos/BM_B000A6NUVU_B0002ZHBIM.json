Build quality is good, but lacks Mac-specific keys like EJECT. Sometimes misses keystrokes, which is frustrating. Space bar is prone to breaking quickly. Keys are transparent and hard to read under direct light. Feels great, but the RF receiver for the mouse is problematic. Spacebar design is flawed, causing it to lock up.
