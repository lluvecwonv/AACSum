            "entity_a": "Out of the box, they are too bassy and the treble is muted; boosting treble and lowering bass improves sound. High impedance requires high volume for best sound reproduction. Sound quality is not worth the $40 price point. Light, easy to carry, and have a nice sound. Sound is muffled with no detectable bass. Great sound quality, surpassing expectations. Too much bass for classical music, better suited for rap/pop. Sound quality is very good with solid bass, transparent mid-range, and crisp highs. Volume has to be near max on a phone compared to other headphones.",
            "entity_b": "Clearer sounding than other headphones near the $29.95 price. Impressive bass and sound good through all frequencies. Sound quality is great, especially for critical listening. Sound is satisfactory, but ear pads may degrade over time. Sound quality is good, but plastic components are fragile. Outstanding sound but somewhat flimsy construction. Good sound quality but lacks full dynamic range. Great noise cancellation and sound quality."

Not ideal for external environments due to semi-open design. The hook for storing headphones is uncomfortable and needs adjustment. Adjustable size and tension, but may still cause discomfort. Good for those who wear glasses as they do not put pressure on frames.",
