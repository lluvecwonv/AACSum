High impedance requires turning them up quite loud for the best sound reproduction. Light, easy to carry, and have a nice sound. Sound quality is not as good as expected for the price. Too much bass blocks out highs, not ideal for classical music. Good bass for rap/pop music. Sound quality is good, comparable to higher-end models. Sound is clear and well balanced. Sound quality is better than factory smartphone headphones. Sound is rich, round, and smooth, lacking brilliance of expensive headphones. Sound is great for jazz music, with good bass response. Sound is amazing for the price with impressive bass. Sound quality is fantastic for this style of headphone. Sound quality is good, with clear vocals and solid bass.

Sound is good but not as effective as higher-end models. Good sound quality for the price. Sound quality is satisfactory for general use. Sound quality is good, but noise cancellation is minimal.
