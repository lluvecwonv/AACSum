Capable of very deep bass, but more than present in the recording requires EQ adjustment. Sound quality is spectacular when used with a FiiO A3 amp with bass boost. Sound is clear without sibilance and has a strong but not excessive bass. Sound is neutral with a flat response, suitable for mixing. Great sound reproduction, especially for studio use. Great for mixing and monitoring music.",
