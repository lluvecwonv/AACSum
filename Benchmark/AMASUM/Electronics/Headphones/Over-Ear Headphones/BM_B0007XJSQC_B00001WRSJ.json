Not ideal for audio editing due to low bass, but suitable for general listening. Sound clarity is high, but headphones require volume adjustment for adequate bass. Sound quality is respectable, but not suitable for high-fidelity needs. High-quality sound for the price.",

Sound quality is excellent with strong bass and clean highs. Sound is accurate and clear without distortion at high volumes. Great sound reproduction with a wide frequency range. High-quality sound suitable for mixing and monitoring. Excellent value for the price with clear and balanced sound."
