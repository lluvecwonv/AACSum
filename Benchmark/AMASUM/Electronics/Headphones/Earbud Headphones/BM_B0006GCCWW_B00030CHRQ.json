Sound quality is great, best with rock or folk music. Sound quality is pretty good, but not the best in its price range. Sound is fantastic, clear and distinct. Smooth, detailed sound. Crisp and extremely clear sound. Magnificent sound quality. Every note and instrument is clear and distinct. Vocals are rich and natural with no distortion. Detail in sound is exceptional. Sound depth and overall sound quality is unmatched in this price range. Presents music in an up-close fashion. Sound quality is superb after 10+ hours of use.",

Sound quality was amazing until a silicone tip was lost. Sound quality is a major upgrade from stock iPod buds. Sound quality is great. Bass is deeper than expected. Sound quality is excellent but reliability is terrible. Instruments sound clear and distinct. Sound is excellent with deep quality. Sound quality is great, but cord length is an issue. Sound quality is great for the price."
