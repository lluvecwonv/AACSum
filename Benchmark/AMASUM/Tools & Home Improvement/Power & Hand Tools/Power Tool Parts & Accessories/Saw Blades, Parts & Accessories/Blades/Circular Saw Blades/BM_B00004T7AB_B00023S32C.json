Cuts through aluminum and PVC cleanly without lubricant issues. Cuts aluminum picture frame molding cleanly with minimal touch-up required. Cuts 6061 T6 Aluminum cleanly and easily. Metal cutting blade provides a smooth cut on plexiglass mirrors without chipping. Fast and clean cuts through extruded aluminum and 2-inch angle. Cuts aluminum like wood with minimal burrs or heat buildup when lubricated.",
