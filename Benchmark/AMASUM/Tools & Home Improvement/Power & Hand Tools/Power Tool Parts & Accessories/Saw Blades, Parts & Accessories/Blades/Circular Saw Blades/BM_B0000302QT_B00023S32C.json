            "entity_a": "The blade performs well on flat cuts despite two missing teeth. Cuts cleanly and quickly, leaving a nice clean edge. Best aluminum cutting blade, also effective for steel. The blade works well in a Rage2 dry cut saw but may wander at very slow feeds. The blade cuts smoothly and precisely, reducing the need for post-cut grinding. The blade is effective for cutting heavier gauge mild steel.",
            "entity_b": "Cuts 3/8 inch steel sheet better than a plasma cutter. The blade is effective for daily use in a small welding shop. Designed for metal cutting at least 1/8 inch thick. The blade is not effective on thinner materials. Great for low rpm circular or chop saws. Cuts steel like butter, suitable for building a tool locker. Recommended for use with the Milwaukee saw made for cutting steel. Performs well on thin stock and quarter inch material."
