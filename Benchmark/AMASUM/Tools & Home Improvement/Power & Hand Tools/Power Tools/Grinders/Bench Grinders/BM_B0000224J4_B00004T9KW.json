The grinder vibrates significantly, affecting the plastic shields and causing them to become unscrewed. Multiple wheel combinations were tried, but vibration persisted. Runs smoothly and quietly when mounted on a heavy-duty stand. The grinder stones are fairly well balanced but do vibrate slightly. Vibration issues out of the box; resolved by removing the medium grit wheel. Moderate vibration likely due to inexpensive grinding wheels. Excessive vibration caused by out-of-balance wheels.",
