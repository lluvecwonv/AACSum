            "entity_a": "Needs to be broken in for accurate grits. Coarse side is not as coarse as expected, better for pre-finishing. Blue side cuts well; red side hones and sharpens effectively. Red side sharpens blades to cut hair. Not recommended for serious material removal. Good for maintaining kitchen knives once in shape. Diamond plates make quick work of resharpening. Fine/super fine stones are great for edge maintenance. Coarse side establishes a bevel well. Good for sharpening a variety of knives and tools. Large sharpening surface suitable for various blade sizes. Course side is slower at removing large amounts of material. Great for sharpening kitchen knives. Fine/coarse sides work as expected. Convenient and useful for everyday use. Keeps knives sharp with minimal effort.",
            "entity_b": "Good for cleaning nicks and burrs on machinery. Flat, sharpens knives well. Prone to becoming packed with material when stoning aluminum. Effective for removing burrs on machine surfaces. India oilstone side works well without producing grit. Best for large surfaces like machine work tables. Nice stone for general shop use. Coarse side removes a good amount of material. Finer side prepares blades well for next sharpening steps. Cuts fast to create an edge, fine side leaves clean sharp edge. Great for sharpening chisels. Good for setting initial edge."
