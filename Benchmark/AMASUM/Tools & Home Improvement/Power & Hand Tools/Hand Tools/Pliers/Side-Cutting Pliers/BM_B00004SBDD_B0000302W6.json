            "entity_a": "Lacks refinement of finish compared to older models. Hefty steel. Poor finish does not affect performance. Newer leverage point makes cutting easier. Edges sharp enough to draw blood, not the cutting edges. Hinge is too tight, requiring more effort to open. Good leverage and oiled hinge. Tip is blunt, reducing usability in certain situations. Finish is rough and incomplete. Proportionality issues with cutting alignment. Plastic trays for Stanley sockets can be opened using these cutters. Uneven grinding and sharp edges. Rough finishing with sharp burrs. Heavy in hand, which can be advantageous.",
            "entity_b": "Long handles provide great leverage. Heavy duty and durable. Highly recommended for electricians. Slightly stiff initially. Aggressive knurling inside the jaws. Great for daily use. Best for electricians."
