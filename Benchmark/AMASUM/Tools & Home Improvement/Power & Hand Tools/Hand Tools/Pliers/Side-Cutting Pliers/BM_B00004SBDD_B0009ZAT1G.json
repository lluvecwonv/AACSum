            "entity_a": "Cuts wire with ease and is made of hefty steel. Effective at cutting trim nails and steel washers. Requires a strong grip to cut through washers. Not as good cutting force as expected. Functional for general use but not heavy duty. Durable and cuts cleanly. Blades undamaged after cutting stainless steel springs. Cuts through wire and plastic easily. Good for cutting wire and welding rods. Durable and retains sharpness after use. Not as strong as Irwin pliers for cutting wire. Not sharp enough for cutting close to a knot.",

            "entity_a": "Blunt tip reduces usability in certain situations. Poor finish, with sharp edges and a tight hinge. Poor quality control with rough and sharp edges. Tight hinge requiring WD-40 for smooth operation. Poor quality with a gap at the cut edge.",
            "entity_b": "Poor alignment of jaws affects cutting performance. Wide mouth and strong cutting blades. Hinge binding issue reducing usability. Ergonomically designed for easy use. Pivot design enhances leverage and reduces effort. Curved handle prevents slipping. Not insulated for cutting hot wires."
