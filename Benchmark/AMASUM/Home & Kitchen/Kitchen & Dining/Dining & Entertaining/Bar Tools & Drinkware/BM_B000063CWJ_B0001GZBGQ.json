Keeps wine chilled during outdoor dining, with the last glass colder than the first. Chills wine quickly but not as fast as advertised. Maintains temperature for wine stored out of the fridge. Can over-chill if used on already cold bottles. Effective for keeping wine cold during transport. Chills wine quickly and keeps it chilled for a long time. Requires two sleeves for optimal cooling of warm whites. Suitable for outdoor dining and parties, better than an ice bucket. Fits well around wine bottles and keeps them chilled for hours. Effective for various beverages, including water and soft drinks. Maintains temperature better than similar products.",

Keeps wine chilled for hours, especially outdoors. Requires pre-chilled wine for optimal performance. Convenient for outdoor dining and wine tastings. Chills wine effectively without ice or water."
