                "We just returned from a mid-winter weekend get away to Montreal. We picked this hotel due to its location in Old Montreal, close to restaurants, Notre Dame and the cobblestone streets. From the moment we arrived when the valet service looked after the car until we checked out the service of the staff was top notch. The rooms were nice with hardwood floors and exposed brick. The bar, Suite701, is the perfect spot for a night cap. We would definately return.",
                "Our company has rented conference rooms and held many meetings and corporate events at Place D'Armes and we were extremely satisfied with their service. There was always someone to greet and help with the setup and make sure we have everything we needed. More importantly, technical service was efficient and really went out of their way (even when it is your own equipment). The rooms are clean and beautiful and staff is great. The only negative thing is that they charge for the conference room for the whole day regardless if you only need it for half a day or an hour.",
                "Absolutely one of the best places to stay while visiting old city Montreal. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooftop bar and restaurant was beautiful with a view of Notre Dame Basilica. We stayed in Junior Suite 3402 and really appreciated the ambiance and decor. If I were to visit again I would think of staying in 3602 (second digit is the floor). The street noise was not bad however you will have early morning local truck deliveries.",
                "The hotel is located in the OLD Town part of Montreal by the Notre Dame Cathedral and short walking distance to the rivers edge. This hotel was a great value and the staff and location were excellent. There are 2 restaurants in the hotel that are very highly rated. The staff and service were excellent. The rooms are specious and nicely decorated The bathrooms are very nice with very big bathtubs. There is also a roof terrace to have drinks and enjoy the views. Couldn't use because it was raining.",
                "Le Place D'Armes is an amazingly elegant hotel with staff that have a beautiful authenticity about them. The comfort and design of the rooms is worth the price and is a great fit for both business or personal occasions. If you are planning a trip to Montreal you simply need to check out this hotel.",
                "Lovely hotel in an historic building with a fantastic location. Nice rooms, very friendly and service-oriented staff. Great little touches like chocolates on the pillow and turn-down service. Very helpful concierge. I was in Laval for business and went to Montreal for the weekend. I walked to restaurants, bars, the river, shopping. Close enough to walk to Mont Royal.",
                "Stayed in one of the Suites which we got using one of the major credit card upgrades. Amazing bathroom with rain shower and a large tub. Modern room, clean bathroom, great service, great beds and blankets. The only thing that it lacks it is a pool but it can be overlooked. Location is great, the old Montreal.",
                "Well I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, it was just wonderful in every way. Perfect location, spotless, nice staff. Possibly the nicest place I have ever stayed. If you go to montreal and dont stay here you're missing out!"

                "This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a suite on the 16th floor that has a plaque that says \"Give Peace A Chance\". The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was too small. I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated. I continually worried that my toiletries would slide off the small shelf for toiletries into the toilet or jewlery would head south for the sink. I had some allergies which I suspect may have been an a/c ducting issue. Beyond these comments it is a nice hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff.",
                "I've stayed here a number of times and this visit was no exception. I find the staff helpful and enjoy the history of the hotel. As well I find the location very convenient.",
                "I stayed here whilst attending a conference in the hotel. Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.",
                "We spent a night at the Queen E with our grandchildren - it is a very nice place to stay - somewhat expensive but right in the center of Montreal. We upgraded to a suite which turned out to be very nice. The restuarant serves great breakfasts and dinners - again a bit expensive but very well done (the liver is great!). We visited the Biodome (lots of fun) and wondered around old Montreal area. Montreal has some great shopping areas we found.",
                "I recently stayed a w.end at this Hotel,and I could not beleive that at the price they charge they put the coffee maker and the coffee as part of the mini bar!come on,most hotel,leave the coffee maker and the coffee free of charge in the room!",
                "My stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere.",
                "Was able to upgrade to the Gold floor and worth every penny. Had dinner at the Beaver club and enjoyed the excellent service. It made our stay very memorable. The hotel is beautiful in the winter, a magical place.",
                "I have been to this hotel countless time as part of frequent business travel. The location is great for business (right in financial centre) and for leisure (5 min walk to St Catherine Street where the shopping and restaurants are). I had an encounter of very bad service once. I took the matter to customer service aftewards and was impressed they listened and offered to upgrade my room next time I stay. Overall it is a good hotel and I would recommand to others."

                "A thank you party for the clients on our first night, staff very polite and room very clean. Close to the CN tower and King street, well located. The fact that you have a complete kitchen and a very nice breakfast included also are some of the reasons to go back to this hotel.",
                "We stayed in the residence inn over a weekend. After a Long drive from chicago we were assigned a room on a high floor as requested with a lovely view of the cn tower! The hotel is in the perfect spot for exploring the surrounding area and has lots of pubs and restaurants in close vicinity also! Book it, you won't be dissapointed :)",
                "I have been staying in Residence Inn for the ast 5 months and its by far the best extended stay hotel I have ever visited. Excelent location,Food and Guest Services",
                "Stayed for 3 nights in August. Excellent location next to the CN Tower. Lovely room with full kitchen - handy with young children - excellent deli round the corner which made preparing meals easier etc. - less stressful than taking youngsters to restaurants. Absolutely superb breakfast each morning. Courteous staff throughout.",
                "The Residence Inn was great. Very central to lots of things but the people working there were what made the stay so enjoybale. Leyla at the front desk was so helpful in guiding us as to what to do and never without a big smile on her face. Franco at the valet was so friendly and helpful and since he was our very frist imprerssion of the Residence Inn it certainly was a good one. The breakfast was great but again the staff was wonderful. Kemika (sp) was so helpful and warm and it certainly made for an enjoyable breakfast time with our family. The rooms were clean and modern. The parking charge was the only downfall at $35 a day. It would be better to include it in the room price.",
                "I have stayed at this hotel numerous times since it opened. I love the location, and the kitchenette in the rooms makes any hotel stay so much more comfortable. Of course, one can never complain about complementary breakfast! The staff has always been super friendly and helpful, from the maintenance and housekeeping staff, to the front desk and valet. Every time I go to Toronto I look forward to staying there!",
                "I was treated very horribly by the staff at this hotel, I would not recommend it to anyone no matter who you are. Maybe its because they are new they don't know how to treat guests but I can tell you this much they ruined my entire stay and never bothered to do anything about it,until I took action. I am disappointed that a Marriott would act like this, but atleast now you know that they are not capable of effectively dealing with problem resolution during your stay.",
                "Excellent location. 5 Minutes walking distance to both the Rogers Centre and CN Tower. Also walking distance to all the nightclubs in the entertainment district. Rooms are brand new and kept spotlessly clean. This property is also reasonably priced with the AAA discount. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this property."

                "My husband and me came for the Monster truck show at Rogers Center on Jan. It was super fun. What the hotel lacks in amenities and services they make up for it by being centralized. Near to the night-club scene, sports arenas; Rogers Center/Air Canada Center. Restaurants, theater, shopping, and best of all, being cheap cheap cheap. Did I mention cheap? The weekend was fun and exciting. Thanks Gravedigger for tarin' the place up!",
                "1. The Strathcona is right in the heart of Toronto. Everything was at hand 2. I am used to the European Hotel of \"getting the arm in\" for a safe deposit box. Therefore it was a great enhancement that the safe deposit box was pro bono 3. The staff and the concierge was more than helpful. Well done & thank you 4. The rooms were lovely & clean & well maintained over our four night stay 5. The rooms were bijou, however we were comfortable because my wife & I are slim. If you are a disgusting big rotund(s); either lose weight or get another hotel 6. I would definitely stay here again",
                "I booked a Deluxe Room which to be honest was worse than Basic Rooms i have stayed in, in other Hotels. Buffet Breakfast was expensive and we ate at other places. Pub was fine though if you like watching Sport. Ideal location though for Attractions.",
                "This place is located right center to all the places we wanted to see. My friend and I went to see a concert and when I called to book they were the only hotel I found who did not talk down to you about not owning a credit card. They are in walkin distance from the train station, the cn tower, hockey hall of fame and the AC and the rogers center. It was amazing and being that we were first timers in a hotel they didn't make ya feel like any question was too stupid. I am going back to toronto and I am staying there again!",
                "The hotel was not cheap - almost 200 Canadian dollars (including tax and a buffet breakfast) per night for a standard room. We were shocked by the so-called \"standard\" room. It was tiny: to do some ironing on the ironing board, or to have access to the electric power points, one literally had to move the furniture around. Cupboard space was inadequate. The shower was lukewarm. The only redeeming featrure was the location: not in an attractive part of Toronto, but at least within walking distance of the CN Tower and the main railway station. I thought it was exceptionally bad value for money, and would not recommend it.",
                "Pros: Good location Affordable Cons: Hotel staff (see below) While our stay started out well, it turned into a disaster by the end. We were situated across from about 2-4 rooms of American college students who were in Toronto to drink heavily, smoke and make as much noise as they possible could. Despite numerous calls to the front desk to remedy the problem, they did absolutely nothing to help. We had two sleepless nights & this put a major damper on what was otherwise a fantastic trip. My advice: Pay the extra money & stay somewhere else!!!",
                "The location of this hotel is its best attribute. I was in Toronto for an Argos football game August 12 and stayed at the Strathcona (for the second time). I paid $83USD for a Friday night. This is cheap by downtown T.O. standards. The room was small and clean with no view at all, but I did not care because I was noe in town for the view or the size of the room. Parking is two blocks down Wellington St. and cost $15CDN for a night -- again not bad by T.O. standards. Overall a perefectly serviceable hotel if you are looking for a clean room in a great location.",
                "My wife and I stayed at the Strathcona while attending the Toronto Film Festival this past weekend. If there are only two in your party, this is a very cozy hotel. Our room was very comfortable and the location was great. You are one block away from the train terminal and the Airport Express shuttle picks you up right across the street. I would definitely stay there again."

                "Good, but not unforgettable This hotel is certainly good enough as a business hotel. However, I really will not stay here for a leisure trip. As mentioned in another review, there are just no personal touches or charm. The staff is polite but the service is more mechanical, rather than from the heart. There is a pool, but it offers a view of skyscrapers nearby. It's really quite hard to relax in this evironment.The location is not bad as it is connected to the subway via a big shopping mall. However, in the morning, a cab ride can take quite long to reach the central business district due to traffic jam.",
                "Would come back again and again We have been staying at Island Shangri-la once every year for the past 7 years. They have continued to improve their service year after year. The service is impeccable. The rooms were renovated a couple of years ago and they added a modern twist. But the level of comfort and 'homeyness' has been retained. With the Pacific Place mall right underneath the hotel, it is so convenient to just go down and shop, knowing that even if you carry a lot of bulky items. There is no worry about riding through the mrt or lining up to get a taxi. You can just catch the elevator and go right up to your room. It is always a perfect experience staying at the hotel.",

                "OK, not spectacular. I spent a few nights at the Shangri La in August. I found the overall experience lacking.The rooms are bland, all function with surprisingly little style (surprising given the strong feng shui influence in HK). The rooms are also small, even by HK/Toyko standards. Lunch at the cafe was expensive and disappointing. Breakfast was much better, though also very expensive.The pool is really nice, and the gym is good. The staff was OK, but interactions felt rushed and reminded me more of a NYC business hotel than a true 5 star.Don't be afraid to try somewhere else.",

For both times, the hotel's location allowed us to make the most out of our short visit to HK. We did not waste any travel time between hotel and airport, either at arrival or for departure, since it was interconnected. We are not hassled or stressed with rushing to the airport to catch our flight. The hotel also had regular free shuttle service to Tung Chung (outlet mall) and several stops at downtown HK. This also saved us bus/train fares. The hotel also has a pool and gym which unfortunately we were not able to try since we were always out exploring HK.",
                "I stayed here for a night in transit to Kathmandu. Average hotel to stay only if you are in transit, otherwise, why one should spend more money here at the airport rather than staying in city areas. Everything was expensive but some of staff were nice and room facilities were okay. So many things in my room was initially not working and I had to call house keeping to fix it such as safety deposit box, TV remote, Refrigerator (with anything inside).....and so on. There was nothing that really attracted me so much. But in general I saw they have different facilities within hotel complex, including many restaurants and bar, pools etc.",
                "My family and I concluded our two-week Easter trip to Berlin and London and returned to Hong Kong. After a long flight, we landed in Hong Kong's international airport around midnight despite very bad weather - raining cats and dogs. As we were very tired and the weather was terrible, we decided to spend the night at the Regal Airport Hotel before returning home in the city centre the next morning. Thanks to the convenient location of Regal, the heavy downpour did not get us wet as the hotel is connected to the airport by an enclosed link bridge. As a regular hotel guest, we got an upgrade this time. Our suite has a family room and a bed room, large and comfortable enough for my family of three. We had the best sleep in days amd woke up the next morning refreshed. The buffet breakfast at the cafe on the lower ground floor was very good too, not to mention the good and friendly services provided by its staff. No wonder, Regal was awarded the best airport hotel title for last couple of years.",
                "I usually avoid airport hotels like the plague, but the Regal at HK is very good. Clean spacious room, good dining facilities and a reasonable room rate.",
                "My third time in this hotel, excellent staff from Front desk. Luggage was sent quickly and quick check in. There is no other hotel closer to the airport. Good location for early flight visitor like me.",
                "A quiet place despite the airport. Free transport was wonderful.",
                "My name is Vince Palumbo and I am a coach/player for the Australian Stickfighting Team, and I would like to tell you all about this beautiful Regal International Airport Hotel which is in Hong Kong. Me and my team of 16 athletes did a one night stop-over in Hong Kong on our way to the Philippines where we were travelling to so that we could all compete at the 2009 World Stickfighting Championships which were being held in Cebu City there in Philippines. Our stay at the Regal International Airport Hotel in Hong Kong was just fantastic, and we all enjoyed the hotel and service very much, so if ever you need to do a stop-over there in Hong Kong for the night, please do not hesitate to contact the manager at the hotel by the name of Mt Jon Chiu, and I am sure that he will bend over backwards to really try and accommodate you or your group. So go ahead and spoil yourself for the night, and I am sure that you will be pleased with the service that you recieve there, ok! Enjoy this Fantastic Hotel in Hong Kong! Regards from GM Vince Palumbo (Australia)",
                "We stayed one night between our flights from Australia to North America and arrived late in the evening. The room temperature never rose above 18 degrees Celcius and the shower taps were broken and therefore shower temperature adjustment was extremely difficult. Service was just OK and the breakfast which was included in our package was pretty good. For the price of the room we did not feel we received good value at all. Room was clean but bed was like sleeping on a sheet of plywood and there were no face cloths."

                "I stayed at the Sutton Place Vancouver for a 4-night business trip. During my stay I, unfortunately, came down with a really bad cold, so I used Room Service, which was excellent. I also ate in the dining room (excellent service). The \"gift shop\" is really more of a convenience store than a gift shop, but there are plenty of other souvenir-type shops around. Convenient walk to shops, restaurants and the stunningly beautiful Vancouver Convention Centre. Very, very comfortable bed. (No back pain, yay!)",
                "This was my third time staying at Sutton Place and love staying here. Great location, clean rooms, comfortable beds, friendly/helpful staff. However, I don't recommend eating breakfast at the restaurant, pretty spendy for what you get. Maybe the buffet is the better way to go. Parking is spendy but hotel usually has a deal that helps cover the cost of parking. But this is my hotel of choice when I come to Vancouver!!!",
                "Sutton Place hotel was a great stay! The location at Burrard and Robson makes it super convenient for shopping and eating - lots of great locations around. Service was spot-on from all the staff. The hotel is a bit old but everything was still clean and renovated. Rooms were roomy and beds really comfortable. I only have 2 complaints - the parking is outrageous (40$ per night), and the hotel charges for internet (20$ per day). I think the hotel would be much better value if they would eliminate or lower some of these charges! Can definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Vancouver!",
                "I travel to Vancouver regularly on business and always stay at the Sutton Place Hotel. It is truly a top end hotel from the well appointed lobby, excellent restaurant, beautiful guest suites and most important of all 5 star pulse customer service. Every staff member greets you with a pleasant smile and no request is considered too small. I stay in La Grande Residence where the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks, relaxed and stress-free. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying \"Welcome back to the Sutton Place\". The beds are very comfortable, you get an excellent sleep. The hotel is the preferred location for many Hollywood actors and crew shooting in Vancouver but the hotel staff treat every guest just as if they were an Oscar winner!",
                "First the service at Sutton Place was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is also great. Unfortunately the hotel itself is outdated and the rooms are in need of an upgrade. The price was very reasonable, but it would be nice to see this hotel receive a much needed makeover.",
                "It is central to all downtown activities and the staff are friendly,and helpful. The restaurant is great with always a little chef's surprise. We also enjoy the pool which has good hours for use. I have stayed with friends and family and for business and never been disappointed.",
                "We were pleased with the location of this Hotel as it is only a 10 minute downhill walk from Canada Place from where the Cruise Ships depart. Our room was clean and comfortable. The Hotel is very close to the main shopping area and across the road we were able to catch the Hop-on Hop-off Trolley Tour.",
                "We stayed here for 5 nights in a grand suite. The rooms were lovely - plenty of room for three of us, beautiful views, very quiet. We had wi-fi and continental breakfast included in our rate - the wi-fi worked flawlessly and the morning pastries were delicious. Service in this hotel is top rate - the concierges helped us with car rental, spa and restaurant reservations. And the location couldn't be better. We were able to walk everywhere downtown. We highly recommend Sutton Place."

I have stayed at many of the better hotels downtown while visiting this great city over the past 15 years. The staff were extraordinarily friendly and helpful without being overbearing. A great experience I will be recommending to friends, family and business colleagues. Thank you L'Hermitage.",
                "We are a family of 5 and had an extremely comfortable 4 night stay in their 2 bedroom suite. Kudos to Jean-michel & Hippo, Raymond, Elaisha, Mitch and a super housekeeping team for being so helpful and friendly. We felt most at home and strongly recommend to all who plan to visit Vancouver. Great location with Japadog and Viet-Sub eateries and Sears, Hudson Bay, Holt Renfrew nearby. Easy access to the main attractions. The team deserves a great pat on their backs for their great work attitude. Special thanks to Jean-michel for going out of your way for us.",
                "We will use this again. We stayed on 3 separate occasions in quick succession. The staff were always helpful, charming and friendly, the rooms elegant and spacious (wonderful bathrooms) and the location was great, particularly if you are flying in (2 blocks down from Vancouver City Centre station on the Canada Line. Don't even think about a cab, on a Sunday when there is no $5 surcharge it cost under $6 for my wife and me to get to the airport. Heathrow and London Underground hang your heads in shame). Treat yourself to the $17.50 breakfast buffet, it must be the best \"posh\" value in Vancouver !",
                "The front desk was fantastic. Check in and check out were a breeze as they let me spend more time with my family and getting to the wedding. It was the perfect end to our wedding night, the room was top notch! Thanks!",
                "If and when I visit Canada again this hotel will be a definite. It is great!",
                "The amenities, breakfast buffet and service at this hotel are excellent. Concierge helped us reserve a table at a great restaurant nearby (Goldfish) and we used the bikes to see Stanley Park.",
                "This is a really great hotel - near new, small boutique style, great rooms more like small apartments with full kitchens. Fantastic pool and sun deck. Not a gripe, but you should know this hotel does not have room service - wasn't an issue for me, but may be for some travellers. great location - close to everything! Really reasonably priced compared to the other hotel i stayed in during my stay in Vanvouver.",
                "We stayed at L'Hermitage in Aug. 2008, just two months after it opened. It is a very sleek, modern hotel in a great location in downtown Vancouver. Because it was so new, the staff seemed to still be figuring things out. For example, we weren't able to check into our room the first night for over an hour after the guaranteed check-in time. To make up for this, the staff comped a round of drinks for us at their wonderful guest lounge on the 5th floor. The website did not do this place justice .... there's a beautiful rooftop pool and hot tub and the rooms are large and luxuorious. Very nice breakfast and afternoon h'or doeurve buffets are included in the price. The staff was very friendly and made sure that all of our needs were met. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be pampered in Vancouver!"

The downtown location proved to be a great starting point for our city explorations. The room was clean, well laid out, and comfortable. The staff was courteous and al spoke flawless English. One evening we decided to sample some local ice wine we had purchased, the hotel quickly brought us glasses, opened, and then served us our wine. The breakfast was delicious, and the selection at the bar was above average. The rooftop garden was beautiful, although we didnâ€™t have time to walk though it in its entirety. Over all I give this hotel my full recommendation.",
                "Hilton Bonaventure definitely provides bang for your buck. The layout for this hotel is very unique. It has many \"wings\" and each wing has access to its own private pool. It also has many water features and excellent landscaping throughout the outdoor patios that are accessible privately via the rooms. You don't even realize that you are on the 17th floor once you get off the main elevator at the reception level and the view of the city from that floor is breathtaking. The staff is quite friendly and accomodating. The only drawback: wired interenet only available for 1 computer in each room. Wireless internet is only available in the lobby. However, I enjoyed my stay!!",

We chose the Bonaventure after much consideration due to it's proximity to the bell Centre( concert Venue and also Hockey Game Venue which my husband was attending). The decision could not have been better.The Bonaventure is connected to Montreal's extensive underground City, lots of shopping, a skating rink, movie theatres...we were thrilled. To say nothing of the friendly hotel staff..to a person they were helpful and welcoming. This is obviously a very well run facility. The management and staff should be proud.",

It was horrible for $100US per night. When I asked for a closer room, I was given a downgraded room. I've never stayed at a 4 star hotel without elevators and no bellmen. Also, the drain in the bathtub was very slow. You end up showering in 4 inches of water.",

The staff was most helpful with directions and other touristy information. The food in the restaurant's food was quite good with a nice selection. We would recommend the Eden Rembrandt Square as our stay was quite good.",
                "The Hotel is perfectly placed for both travel and entertainment on the edge of Rembrandt Square. It is within very easy walking distance to everywhere in Central Amsterdam, but sufficiently on the edge for it to be quiet at night. It has a first class seafood Bistro if you wish to eat in. It's main clientele are business and corporate, which should tell you a lot about the overall quality and respect this hotel has. This has been my hotel of choice, even when travelling privately to Amsterdam with family.",
                "The location of the hotel is excellent. Its 5 mins from the Waterlooplein metro station and hence easily accessible. Room service was mediocre - the staff came to clean the room once in 3 days in spite of a reminder. Hotel rooms were of good size.",
                "- First thing is the location, no need for public transport, we could walk from hotel to anywhere. - No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause in the walking distance of 20-50 meters on the Rembrandt square there are cheaper places to eat. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs. I remember one was awesome, one was terrible, and in the third we couldn't enter, the tickets were sold out. And there is a great coffeshop just by the entrance of hotel :D - Very clean, tidy and a safe hotel for reasonable price. -I'm definintely sleeping there again and recommending it to friends.",
                "Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time. The room was immaculate, and the bed amazingly comfortable to the point that we did not leave it until lunch time on the first morning! And was just as hard on day two..... Great location too. We paid for a cab from Central St on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was â‚¬20 and was only a 5 minute ride. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully be going back in the near future!",

A couple of things to note: My room had mosquitos (common for AMS this summer), they were fully booked so could not give me another room but did eventually find some fly spay so problem solved. Breakfast is expensive at EUR15, just take a walk down the street and have a better breakfast in one of the cafes.",
                "I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and Expedia, with a real priority for me being its cleanliness and quietness. It didn't disappoint on either count and had the added bonus of being in an excellent location - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful. The modern room was nice and the bathroom was excellent, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet. I'd definitely book here again."

They rent bicycles themselves, so you are not attached to the time of rental stores. For example you can return the bike in the middle of dawn. Nice and stylish rooms. They upgraded me to a better room with canal view. They respond to all e-mails, request. They are 100%.",

The rooms are divine, very large and beautifully decorated - the most comfortable beds and pillows - we even managed to get a room with a superb view over the canal. I loved the fact that everything is within walking distance - the museums, flower market etc. Will definitely go back. Yes it's a little pricey but well worth every penny!",
                "We stayed there for around 5 days in April of this year and would definitely stay there again if finances allow. The staff was very friendly and professional. The room was very nice and clean. We had a room overlooking the canal so that made it even nicer. Free wireless internet in the room. Nice clean bathroom. Comfortable bed. The location is also great, it was pretty much walking distance from everything we wanted to do. It was pretty expensive, but I do believe you get what you pay for - high quality! No complaints at all.",
                "Located on the Herengracht, one of the old canal rings encircling the city, the Ambassade is beautifully decorated - we were open-mouthed at the quality of the furnishings. And it was staffed with friendly, knowledgeable, multilingual employees. The location was perfect - we were within walking distance of museums, the Dam, the Red Light District, the Begjinhof, great restaurants and bars (we loved the Five Flies just around the corner, built in 1634). The breakfast was sumptuous, but seemed a bit pricey, so we only tried it once. WE stayed for 3 nights, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",
                "Spent a night at this very comfortable hotel. One of the most comfortable rooms I have ever been in. Everything is perfect. Hotel is centrally located bu quiet.

Interior does need updating and is rather worn and dated - however, location compensates for this.Breakfast is a bit of a joke though and unless you are there when it goes out forget it, my 1st morning there I arrived at about 8.15am to be told there was nothing left!

All the rooms we saw smell from odor. We had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room, which is still 2 star in my opinion. The elevator is not large enough for a surfboard to fit in it (kind of ironic don't you think), so you have to leave your board in a lockup room in the lobby.",

We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price 鈥?even with daily parking 鈥?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice. Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne 鈥?a very nice touch.

I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. The hotel was completely booked (President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week, but you would never know it. You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for!! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.)

The room in the Kahlia tower was newly built and very luxurious, with a small patio and a great view out to sea. The resort is very large with many shops and a great selection of restaurants. We chose to leave the property and go next door for dinner to Kobe Steakhouse, well worth the walk. Over all this is a great resort for either a stop over before your Hawaiian vacation or even a week long visit. Expect resort prices for food and drink, but good quality.",

You can quickly become spoiled to the twice a day maid service and the nightly turn-down service. You would have a wonderful vacation if you never left the Village. Everything you can possibly need or want is there. I even look forward to the almost daily trips to the ABC store! Just steps away from the beach, HHV is truly a part of paradise!"

                "Hotel Raphael is absolutely gorgeous! It is very comfortable, clean and quiet. A reasonable journey from Campiano Airport should cost you no more than 40 euro. Our sheets were changed every day and the delicious chocolates on our bed every night were fantastic. The Bulgari toiletries smell gorgeous so enjoyed several long soaks in the bath. Breakfast is amazing, made extra special by starting the day with a refreshing 'Bucks Fizz' Everything about the hotel is perfect the staff are very courteous and are most helpful. Would highly recommend and would most definately visit again. - Mike and Alison",
                "A beautiful hotel in a very bustling area of Rome. You expect everything to be perfect at an R&C but this is an entire staff taking service to whole new level. Arrangements for cars, tours and restaurants via email...way before you get there. Thanks Anna. A glass of prosecco delivered anywhere in the hotel at the direction of Stephen in the restaurant. I can't say enough about this hotel",
                "Selected hotel via Australian website. Very good value. Great location - could walk to all main places and sights in Rome. Brekky was a good size buffet and on roof top garden at level 6. Rooms not huge but good and nice bathroom. Wifi worked and was free. Loved having pre-dinner wine on roof top while seeing the sun go down on St Peter's basilica.",
                "Our second stay here in 12 months and the service from this hotel is enough to make me want to return to Rome, just so I can stay here again!!!! The location is second to none and we have been able to walk to all the main sights from here. We have stayed in three different rooms at this hotel and they have all been fabulous. The buffet breakfast is very good and the rooftop is a pleasant area to enjoy a drink or two after a long day of sight seeing. We were left 'tasty treats' on our room every day and we love the adjustable beds.The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and the doorman was a delight!!!! Hopefully we'll see you again next year!!!!!!",
                "We were upgraded to a suite upon our arrival, and it only got better each day. The location is perfect for accessing all the historic sights on foot, and there were tons of fantastic restaurants right nearby.",
                "Highly recommend Hotel Raphael as it was perfect for my solo holiday. Hotel Staff were excellent in making my stay comfortable. The hotel is perfectly situated in Piazza Navona so close to dining and shopping and of course historic sites.",
                "Like the other reviewers, I have to say this hotel is close to perfect. The rooms aren't as large as I would have liked (we were upgraded for an 8 night stay from a deluxe to one of the Richard Meier ultra-modern rooms on the two \"executive\" floors). I had been to Rome once before and, on the recommendation of friends, stayed in a fancy hotel on the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto area is sterile and not fun and we didn't really enjoy our stay there. But the Raphael, just off Piazza Navona in the historical center, is a whole other story. You walk out the door and you're right there, in the midst of everything. As befits a Relais & Chateaux hotel, everything is elegant and the staff and service are the best. Really, the only problem is paying the bill at the end!!",
                "We stayed at the Raphael for 3 nights and we had an enjoyable stay there. Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated Richard Meier rooms, which was very nice, with a spacious bathroom and clever use of the available space. The hotel corridors could benefit from a decoration as they were a bit plain, and the elevator needs a small facelift, but nonetheless it was fuctional and the guest doesn't spend any time there. Breakfast was quite good, especially for Italy, and the location just off piazza Navona, ideal. The only downside is the staff, which while friendly and kind, didn't go beyond their duties for advice etc."

                "I can't say enough about the wonderful Hotel Campo De Fiori! The location is perfect for sight seeing in Rome. The rooms are typical European sized but beautiful and well-appointed. I was a little concerned about potential noise from the nearby square but with my windows shut I didn't hear a peep. The photos on the web site are accurate and the roof-top deck is a dream! The breakfast was ample with excellent coffee. The best thing about the hotel is the amazing staff - Valentina, Matteo, Barbara, Gabriele, Angelo, Adam, Andrea & Andrew - not only efficient and well-versed on the city, they were kind hearted and lovely. They bent over backwards to make my stay truly special and I can't wait to return!",
                "Great hotel with very kind and very helpful personnel. The roof garden is absolutely great! Very nice view over Rome. The rooms are lovely! The location is perfect: at the Campo de' Fiori and near the ancient centre of Rome.",
                "I would so recommend this hotel for the location, the accomodations, the friendliness of the staff and the amazing roof garden. I thank Travel Advisors for sending us in the right direction in the first place",
                "My wife and I visited Rome for the first time this past November, and we couldn't be happier with our stay at Hotel Campo de Fiori. The location of the hotel is perfect, 5 minute walk to most of the sites, 20 minute walk to the Vatican City and 20 minutes the other way to the Coliseum. The hotel staff is extremely helpful and make good recommendations on restaurants (La Scalla and The Library were two of our favorites, and will go back for sure to both). The rooms were smaller - but they were loaded with character and the bathrooms were superb.",
                "If you are looking for a place with a central location and superb roofterrace and don't mind being ripped off, this is it. All you need to overlook is the dreadfull breakfast (for instance, the cheese had never seen a cow and the orange juice looks radio-active), the claustrophobic rooms and lack of any extras cq basics in the room (water, toilettries, etc.) that you might expect for the price they charge.",
                "After our port intensive Med cruise it was a relief to have such a haven as this hotel to unwind for three nights. We loved our top floor room with it's own terrace and the access to the fabulous large rooftop terrace was right outside our door. The terrace was not only a great 360 degree view of the historic area of Rome but it was such a great social place to join others over wine in the hours leading up to sunset. Magic. The staff is so helpful and made us feel so welcome there. Highly recommend this boutique hotel.",
                "Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner in August '09. The hotel is located 50m around the corner from the famous Campo De 'Fiori which is a wonderful area for eating and drinking as well as having great nightlife. The room itself was beautifully done in a period setting. Bed was large and aircon was fine. Staff extremely passionate and friendly about when and where to see the sights. Location is excellent as only a 5 minute walk to the piazza navona, 10 min walk to the trevi fountain and pantheon and 15 min walk to Vaticano and Colosseum. Also only a 10 min walk to the river and the wonderful trastevere area of eating/nightlife. There is a viewing deck above the top floor which is great to relax and have a few drinks and offers a really nice view of the area as well which was a bonus! No complaints whatsoever here, had a wonderful stay!",
                "Thank you very much for your hospitality while we stayed with you during Aug 1 - 4, 2008. My wiffe and I were extremely pleased with the hospitable staff, general cleanliness, quiet rooms, delicious breakfast and all. The overall experience at your hotel was very good and this made Rome even better for us. We would look forward to coming back to Rome to stay in the Hotel Campo de' Fiori. Thank you."

Our room was a good size with an ENORMOUS bathroom, and views of the campanile. Breakfast was excellent...I found the hotel pretty much faultless. And Florence? Just beautiful.",

Turn two corners and you are in the piazza next to Giotto's campanile. As an american who speaks fluent italian, and a mother of 3, I never go to Italy to sleep in 5 star resort hotels. This hotel could never be compared to the Four Seasons, but, in Florence, it was the perfect place to start and end each day."

Being not on a thoroughfare, it is quiet at night. Its situation in relation to the main attraction, the Piazza del Duomo, is a seven to ten minute's walk. There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity, especially just opposite is the restaurant Il Cardellino. At the reception English and French is spoken.

The rooms are simple, but clean and we slept well for five restful nights. The common room is very comfortable, as is the breakfast area. The patio serves dynomite gin tonics for happy hour. The hotel is a pleasant walk from the main downtown sights in a less touristy and more local scene. Would definitely stay there again.",

Central location - only a few minutes walk from the Accademia, but tucked away in a side street so as quiet as it can be in Florence (or any major city for that matter!). Ask for room 45, on the 4th floor (don't panic there is a lift), if you want a room with a balcony and a view over the roof tops to the Duomo and Campanile. Continental breakfast was light but adequate, but hotel too small to serve dinner - not a problem with so many good restaurants to choose from! Go and enjoy!",

Bathroom could use a little updating but would speculate that it has been updated within last 10 years. Good American style stand-up shower. The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, is well above average and in a lovely room which also has a very nice terrace. Friendly front desk.",

The only time that we opened our window was on the last day of our stay (it rained) & was shocked to find out that the window sill was full of black molds. My son had his first asthma attack when we went home. I've just read another review from a previous guest abt. 2 months ago stating the same problem with the molds/mildew. Obviously, the hotel didn't do anything about it.",
                "We Were only in rome for 2 days and 2 nights and found Express a good place for a short stay. At first we thought the area looked a bit Dodgey But compared to Rome centre it is not too bad. There is a nice Restaurant (Sacco) just around the corner which, although a little pricey, is very pleasant. It is very close to the Station, Just a 10 minute walk and another 10 to Termini Station. Also There is free parking just outside reception",
                "We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Rome - San Giovanni for 3 nights during our 8 day trip in Italy. On our last morning, we were told to leave our baggage at the lobby while breakfast and we did. When we returned, we sadly found out that one of our baggage, the one containing most of our gifts, was missing. Since we wouldn't be able to go back and get new ones, it was really devastating for us. The staff members were not even slighly interested in the situation. We asked for police assistance but they didn't even bother to call; saying the police could do nothing about it. Nobody asked about what happened or anything; as if nothing had happened. The apathy, the staff members showed, made us regretfully think that some of them may have something to do with the robbery.",
                "My wife and I were in November 2006 for one night only and paid with reward points. Wish have stayed longer. Nice and superclean clean modern hotel, superb breakfast with plenty of variety and fresh capuccino made in front of you, and very helpful and polite staff both in reception and breakfast room that makes your stay even more enjoyable. Even thought not in centre of Rome, close enough by public transportation very easy and accesible: bus line 85 runs often one block from hotel, takes you to Colesseum and near Trevi? Metro linea B, about 5 blocks from hotel takes you to centre or Ananigna to take bus to Ciampino, and train to Fiumicino airport 2-3 blocks from hotel: only 5 euros takes you in a bit without stops. Only problem with Metro line B is that stopped working after 9:00PM. Hope it changes soon, but still OK. Would definitely reccomend hotel to anybody and cannot wait to go back now in June for 2 nights.",
                "This is a good hotel, it is very decent , nice rooms(though I'm not sure if it has air conditioning), it is very close to the Metro, which was our main transportation throughout our trip. it also has a bus station a minute away that is also very usefull. Money well spent!",
                "We stayed at Holiday Inn Express Rome San Giovanni simply going by what others had to say about the place in Tripadvisor. I am glad I did that. I got a good price on the hiexpress website by booking in advance. Though the hotel is not right in the heart of the city, it is a very convenient to get there by bus. We also used the sub way station but that was a longer walk. The rooms are very clean and modern. The front desk staff are helpful . Breakfast was good with a lot of choice. Would definitely stay there again."

                "having just returned from a weeks stay at the universo hotel,i found it to be good value for money,on our arrival we did not have the room we booked and were disappointed,when we brought this to the hotels attention our room was changed the next day which we were more than happy with,breakfast was also very good with lots to choose from,don't understand the negative comments regarding breakfast on some reviews.i would definately return to this hotel.",
                "Hotel's location is amazing since its 2 mins walk from the main train station that will take u to airport in 25 mins. 10 mins away from downtown (walking) and around 15-20 from Coloseum !! Central location, with lots of hotels around Friendly staff, and really AMAZING breakfast. The restaurant is not the best you can get. Really nice rooms :)",
                "We stayed 4 nights, and felt secure and comfortable. This is a fairly impersonal hotel, where the staff did not speak unless spoken to, although they were helpful when requests were made. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Our room was a loft, with the king bed up the stairs from the sitting area and bathroom. Several good restaurants nearby.",
                "We had a great stay. Close to the train station and many attractions. We walked all over Rome from here. Great breakfast, clean rooms, but the staff was makes it extra special.",
                "Don't expect t set yur thermostat below 80 degrees. No matter what setting you use, the front desk controls the room temperature and will not set it below 26 Celsius, or 78 Fahrenheit. Disgusting sleeping temperature, and of course does not make for a good vacation. Never again.",
                "Good location if you plan to stay close to Termini rail station is a few minutes walk. Hotel itself not really impressive the rooms are very small with no drawers and a tiny bathroom with a shower only. Does have air conditioning which is about the only good part .Buffet Breakfast was good but overall I wouldn’t stay again at this hotel",
                "You will be comfortable at this hotel. The rooms and baths are large; cleaning service is excellent. It is relatively quiet in busy, central Rome, therefore a very good location to stay for sightseeing. The main Metro terminal is a short walk away. Breakfast is entirely adequate and complimentary. There is a free Internet connection in the lobby and rooms are wired for the Internet. One caution: should you need to telephone the USA, the hotel phones offer a \"1508\" access code. While the connection is fast and clear, the charge for a timed brief call of two or theee minutes is over $40 usd. Use your ATT card for international calls and save.",
                "We stayed here twice in May and would happily stay again. The rooms were spacious, the breakfast was yum, and the staff were friendly and helpful. You could walk to a lot of Rome's attractions from here but we chose to use the hop on hop off bus which had a stop just around the corner."
