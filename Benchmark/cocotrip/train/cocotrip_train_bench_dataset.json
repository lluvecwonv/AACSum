                "Large, modern, clean rooms across from one of the few beaches in Key West. While far from downtown, this hotel offers a lot of comfort, a nice little pool, and regular shuttle service. We would stay there again!",
                "This hotel has huge rooms and bathrooms and is in a great location across from the beach and close to the airport. Great food in the restaurant and staff is wonderful! I highly recommend to anyone needing some extra space and doesnt care about being downtown!",
                "This place can be summed up in one word ... flawless ! Located across the street from the most beautiful beach in Key West - Smathers Beach and literally 1.7 miles from Duval street it is prefect!!! The service was fantastic, the grounds are very well kept, with a cool pool.... and the piece de Resistance ... the room - comfortable, huge, it is literally the size of a small apartment, with a small kitchenette, a dining table a huge couch and and super comfortable bed, oh yeah and the bathroom is also pretty darn big. We had a magical weekend staying here and every went on without a hitch, good laid back service at a very reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Key West. Since we brought our bikes, we did not have to move our car at all in the 3 days we were there, Duval street is just a short ride from the hotel.... don't own a bike? Or don't feel like shipping them down with you ? No problem, the hotel has plenty of bikes for rent as well.",
                "The hotel has a great location, across from the beach and away from Duval street, but a free shuttle every hour into town and airport. Rooms are all suites large and comfortable with microwave and wet bars, living room areas , well designed space with pocket doors to close off the bedroom for privacy. Comfortable beds and nice vanity area, lots of storage space. We were a large group and treated very well. The restaurant staff was particularly accomodating. As people in our group trickled into the restaurant , we kept adding to tables, asked for separate checks etc and it was never a problem. Many of us asked for a late checkout last minute and they accomodated as many as possible. Pool was heated and lovely, a hot tub in the corner. Restaurant closed at 9 and bar at 11pm, a little early for our crowd and Key West but that is my only complaint.",
                "The hotel was decorated beautifully for X-mas and I loved the Palm trees with Christmas lights! The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rate was what is to be expected for Key West, right by the airport! The beach is across the street from the hotel with multiple activities for one to participate in. Since the hotel is out of the was a smidge, they offer shuttles, numerous shuttles to all the hot spots in Key West. The rooms were beautiful, and very clean, unless you looked directly behind the toilet, which could use a little extra scrubbing. I would stay here again, tomorrow!",
                "We went to enjoy Key West and our daughters were so excited and this motel was a complete disappointment!!!! Dirty, unsafe, only thing really redone was the lobby!! Elevators were very scary, our daughters would not even ride without us.",
                "The hotel is an all suite hotel so the rooms were very spacious and allowed us to kick back in our room mid afternoons and mornings. If you like a slower pace and a public beach across the street, this is a good place to stay. You will have to drive or take the shuttle to Duval Street area and the shuttle is only once an hour. Parking in the Duval Street area will cost from $10 to $35 per day.",
                "I took my girlfriend here for a long weekend and to propose. The hotel was great, obviously, it wasn't a St Regis or even a Westin, but it was very nice, very functional and enjoyable. The food and services were VERY expensive... I thought they took care of us well even though we were staying on points for free."

                "It was a very comfortable and fun place to be at the end of an active day/evening in town. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed the outside restaurant at breakfast and thought the lavish poolside landscaping was beautiful. Also enjoyed the live entertainment at the tiki bar. This was our second visit to Key West and we much preferred staying at The Inn at Key West instead of staying in town.",
                "Exceeded our expectations ten fold. Clean, friendly, gorgeous, only draw back is the location but it was also nice to be away from the main strip.",
                "Up till today this rating could not have said enough about this hotel unbelievable pool great service at poolside bar from Ed, Zack and Gracie. except for room not cleaned till 3:30 rave reviews great beds clean updated great experience......... Then today..still good service from Angela the bartender but ??? bar full of local kids/angela's friends?,drinking heavily, dropping the F bomb every couple of minutes and getting loud and obnoxiousthey took up whole side of bar and most of Angela's time and sounded like they frequent the pool often so my question to the mangaement is the bar and pool for the use of your guests or the local kids. Big mistake we are the ones that pay for the rooms maybe you want to reconsider the use of the pool/ bar as for guest use. So far this is the only glitch in a wonderful stay with courteous staff hopefully and anamoly. I would still highly recommend this Inn and its serene setting if some rules too the bartenders are made no drunken friends monopolizing the bar one incident doesn't warrant a bad report.",
                "Many nice things - walking distance to McDonalds and IHOP-breakfast there for 13.95/free coffee for guests-great location - right across from Gulf-Staff extremely helpful-has trolley you can reserve spot on (on/off all day long) to see al of the well-known spots-my son did jet skiing and it was the same price as at home :) IF you live in florida ask for your Florida residence rate and that made it affordable for us - pool was beautiful -I would stay there again for sure!!",
                "Everything about this place is top-notch. The lobby is beautiful - the staff is cheerful, friendly and helpful. They make changes and solve problems with a great attitude. The rooms are clean, well-furnished and comfortable. The pool area and hot tub are well-maintained and a great place to just kick back. This would be my first choice if I ever return to Key West. Highly recommended.",
                "My wife wasn't too thrilled that I booked this hotel. She wasn't impressed by the outside. Her mind changed as soon as we entered our room. She loved it. It was one of the cleanest hotel we've stayed at. The staff was very nice. I would stay here on my next trip to the keys.",
                "We stayed two nights at this overpriced hotel! It looks just like a dirty motel with filthy rugs and roaches! The staff was rude and not very helpful! You can stay at lovely B&B in old town that is actually cheaper than this dump! Please stay away!",
                "\"The Inn at Key West\" has accomodations at the level of roadside motels, but charges much higher prices. Rooms are small, with uncomfortable beds, dirty rug, and worn-out furniture. The only places that look better than other motels are the lobby and pool. However, nobody sleeps in the lobby... The pool area was crowded, with many smokers wandering around, giving second-hand smoke to children cheerfully playing. I booked a room with two queen beds, but they gave me one with a king bed. Talking to the hotel staff and customer rep of Hotels.com proved to be wasting of time -- almost an hour to be exact. Did I mention that the hotle is inconveniently located outside of the old town where the attractions are? I'll never stay here again!"

                "This hotel is a great value, the service is very friendly, the inner courtyard with small pool and lights strung across palm trees is a lovely oasis, and the rooms are clean and equipped with AC, tv and small deposit box. There was a high vaulted thatched roof which made the room feel airy but unfortunately not too sound proof. Right across from the new ADO bus station so a good place to stay if you are catching an early morning bus from the station. Just a couple blocks from 5th ave where all the action happens at Playa.",
                "Small but very comfortable rooms. Extremely helpfull staff. No private parking. Near all of 5th Ave fun.",
                "Very good 3 star hotel a few blocks from beach.Everyone very helpful.Rooms large with patios and hammocks,nice little courtyard with small pool.",
                "This little hotel is lovely with nice rooms with a lot of character. Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Free breakfast at their sister hotel about a five minute away is nothing special but very good. Only problem was that the hot water didn't last very long, but everything else was perfect.",
                "We stayed at Playa del Karma on a recommendation from a friend. We were extremely satisfied with the accomadations and the staff. This hotel was the best hotel I've ever stayed at in terms of value for what you receive. The rooms are cute (a little rustic but clean and comfortable), the courtyard is beautiful and the staff went above and beyond to serve us or answer questions. The location is great, just three blocks from the beach. We would definitely come back...",
                "For those of us baby boomers who remember being sensitive flower children Hotel Play del Karma really suited us. The mature greenery of the courtyard had the serenity and grace of years of wise existence; of course we could relate! The patter of raindrops on the thatched roof of the room reminded us that we were in a beautiful tropical climate. It was a charming effect that would have been absent had we stayed in a concrete & glass megalith. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience here. The breakfasts above the garden were special.",
                "We had a wonderful time at Playa del Karma! We finished our Yucatan-trip with 2 nights, and really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. We had two several rooms (one at the garden and one above the lobby/reception), both really nice with lots of space and big beds! The Italian people who run this place are really helpful with everything you need and provide great service with the breakfast buffet (we loved the mexican eggs in the morning) and free beachtowels. Playa del Karma is a lovely place with a beautiful garden with a small but wonderful pool, lovely to relax after a day at the beach.",
                "We had a pleasant stay at hotel playa karma. It's located on a busy street so if you're a light sleeper, the traffic might bother you at night. We did hear the dog a couple of times but was it was only for a few minutes. Overall, I was impressed with their customer service. The staff was very nice and accomodating. Mario was very friendly. We arranged a couple of tours with karma trails and we were happy with the tours we chose. Antonello arranged a breakfast-to-go box before we headed out to one of our tours in the morning and it was abundant, filled with fruits, bread, water and cake. If you prefer a hotel with great customer service, choose hotel playa karma."

This is a very low-key facility - rooms do not have TVs, radios or even clocks - but the beds are comfortable and the showers work well. We stayed in the Garden area which was quite nice - and still only a short walk to the beach. Every room has a sheltered porch with two hammocks and a table and chairs. The location is near (a couple of blocks away) from the main shopping street. The beach is well maintained. All-in-all, a very nice place and a good value. A few complaints - could use better internet accessibility and some of the hotels in the area have music blasting a bit too loudly at times.",

                "16 years and still coming back. It is such a fun, laid back, wonderfully relaxing place without a phone in your room or a tv blaring in your ear. Kids around the pool, adults talking, the sound of wind, waves, and yet it is quiet. Excellent staff, food, and you sit next to the ocean or inside comfort....it is not at all like an all inclusive, thank goodness. It is specially unique.",
                "Clean hotel rooms, large tiled bathrooms, fans and air conditioning make for excellent cabana-like rooms. Each equipped with two hammocks for a lazy day at the beach. The sand is clean and pure, the food is excellent (2 meals a day are inclusive) and the location is central to every shop, restaurant and anything else you could want. This is truely a diamond in the rough.",
                "If you are looking for complete peace, beauty, and relaxation away from the crazy commercialism of Cancun, this is the place. The resort is located only 45 minutes south of the Cancun airport and the resort will arrange for transportation to and from the airport for you. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and will go out of their way to assist you with whatever you may need. The property itself is very beautiful and landscaped throughout with lush gardens. It is as close to paradise as one can get. Mahekal is in walking distance of 5th Avenue (main strip for shopping, restaraunts, etc.) Mahekal has a wonderful wedding planner on staff who helped arrange everything for my wedding from the flowers to the hair dresser, photographer and priest. The resort and beach is beautiful, the food is outstanding, the people are extremely friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere is completely relaxing. Without a doubt, this is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had and am looking forward to going back again this year....and hopefully many more to come.",

                "A most relaxing holiday spot..the staff worked so hard to repair the hurricane damage,but in such a unobtrusive way that one's stay there was not impaired in the least.The beach area was always tidy,ample beds and shade,good service at all times and the room was directly facing the sand...blissful.I confess I didn't want to do anything but take to my sunbed,read,swim,bask and take refreshment..I felt secure there at all times;there was always an attendant around even at night but again without having a strong-arm presence.The hotel guests were obviously having a good time;the friendly approach of the dining attendants ensured this at meal-times.The towels in the rooms were \"sculptured\" into an array of animals,with a new piece of artwork appearing at every room service. And as a final touch...on the morning of our departure,we were given a breakfast box;this contained appetising food and drink. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough....a credit to Mexico and a jewel in the Yucatan!"

The hotel is as close as can be to the (as far as I know) only public parking on the island, so we did not have to drag luggage through the entire city center, a serious advantage considering that, at night, you can spot desperate travellers pulling their bags over the bridges, swearing and sweating. The hotel is a charme, located in an old monastery with a beautiful garden, a large bar in the old refectory (with an intact pulpit). Kids slept (4 & 7) with us in a large room with high ceilings, clean with good beds. The guys at the reception are friendly and funny. The breakfast was rich. The station of the grand canal \"vaporetto\" is very close by, as is in fact the entire city center. Overall, a greate place to stay, visiting Venice with our without small children (and certainly if you came by car).",
                "I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. If you like luxury, I wouldn't stay here but it was a great value for the price. The location is great and the staff are very helpful. It is only a block from train station and one of the main lines of the vaporetti so you can always catch a boat back home. It does get flooded but the hotel has boots for you to borrow. The breakfast was okay, it is a standard European continental breakfast. The lobby also has free wireless and you can borrow one of their laptops.",
                "We stayed for four nights at the Hotel Abbazia and couldn't have been more impressed. The rooms were huge and very clean, breakfast was wonderful and the staff could not have been more helpful or pleasant. It was very convenient to the ACTV and the train station.",
                "Just returned from a second stay in the Abbazia. Hotel staff very friendly. Could not fault anything. Great location and yet so quiet (well apart from the church bell!!). Just lovely!",
                "Great hotel, conveniently located near the train station, no need to struggle with luggage on the boats. Easy to get to anywhere else. Staff were great and very helpful in all respects. Room was great, plenty of space (although we did get an upgrade for our anniversary present) Breakfast in the garden a must. Note this is the only hotel I have ever stayed in (and that is a lot) where the mini bar prices seem to be more favourable than outside. (Odd but true) Would definitely stay here again.",
                "The hotel provides an excellent service for the site seeing traveller. It is in a great location right next to the station. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are basic but spacious and clean. We would certainly recomend this hotel!"

                "In the middle of everthing. St. Marks, Museums, anf fine restarants. I really believe I could spend the rest of my life in this most beautiful city. The hotel and staff are magnificent. We have stayed there on two separate trips now and look forward to the third soon. My wife just loves to get lost waling the canals and alleways. Wonderful breakfast at the hotel as well. Steps away fro the San Zaccaria vaparetto stop.",
                "My wife and I returned to this superbly placed hotel for a wonderful four day break. (100 metres from St Marco). Right from the start, whilst making my reservation by phone, Jacopo made me feel welcome, and this wonderful service contiued throughout our stay. The resturant for breakfast is right on the lagoon and to sit outside in the sunshine and start your day with a plentiful multi choice breakfast is a pure joy. This lovely Hotel helped make our trip to this very special city all the more enjoyable. Our room was not large but perfectly equipped. A Lagoon view would have made it even better (maybe next time) I am sure there will be a next time, and definately at Savoia and Jolanda.",
                "Definately the best bed i've slept during our vacation, rooms immaculates, wide choice at the restaurant for breakfast(homemade cakes!!!!). More then central position facing the san marco basin....5 stars!!!!",
                "Okay after all the rave reviews of other guests I was expecting amazing. Guaranteed we had the crapiest weather over the NYE period, but we had paid for a package deal and half of what we paid for we never saw, they took some money off the final bill but even still what was outlined in our package was not included. The staff were aloof; one gentleman behind the counter was very approachable however the rest were rather aloof. The room was probably the smallest we had stayed in ad had a slanting roof which proved extremely difficult to move around as you were continually hunched over. The staff were not overly interested in what you did and in informing you of anything to do or see, which was quite disappointing after the fantastic experiences we had had in Rome and Florence. Maybe this is the service you receive when you go to Flashy hotels and if this is the case then I am happily never going to a fancy hotel again - midrange hotels for me (better value for money)",

                "what a beautiful place looking out onto the St giorgio magiore church island. The rooms with views are quite expensive...but venice is a precious place with very little space. the restaurant is good (especially the free breakfast)...but explore the many small trattorias, restaurants, and pannini bars..for much better though. the best value compared to cipriani, hilton danelli etc...would highly recommend",
                "The hotel is very conveniently located from the San Marco stop and faces the Grand Canal. The staff were not necessarily friendly, but they were not rude either. They were helpful in giving us information and directions as well as storing our luggage after checkout so we could explore a bit before our scheduled time of departure. We were pleasantly surprised when we returned after dinner to find turn down service and chocolates on our pillows :-)",
                "We stayed here for three nights in January 2004 as part of our honeymoon and we loved it. We did request a balcony room as recommended on trip advisor. It was beautiful a perfect view of the grand canal. It s location was perfect three doors away from the bridge of Sighs and 200 m from St. Marks Square. The room was plush , exposed beams, tastefully decorated but a bit disappointed that there was no bath in the bathroom... and room (or suite as it was called) was small by suite standards....1 room.(Bed with a couch and table) I would highly recommend it if you wanted to splash out for a special occassion it is a bit pricey..."

                "Third time staying at this quaint family owned and operated hotel - and just as enjoyable a stay as previous visits! Located in centro storico Roma within view of the mighty Roman coloseum. There are plenty of little restaurants, coffee shops, and tiny grocery stores in the vicinity. A tasty buffet breakfast is served each morning in the rooftop terrace dining room - including custom made delicious cappucini! :) Many, many thanks to the delightful family and staff of Hotel Apollo. We appreciate all your kind care & thoughtfulness. We look forward to our next trip to Rome and again staying at your hotel!",
                "Great location...walking distance from Coloseum. The small pizza place next door....is a must place to take out....Night staff did not speak English...but day staff did. They arranged a cab for us...who was there ahead of time....Breakfast was heavenly....",
                "We selected this hotel because of the location. It was great. We did not stayed at the hotel itself but in an apartment some corners away. It was big, clean and had all that we were looking for. Lots of restaurants, a metro stop in front (Cavour) and the colisseum just some minutes away. When going back to Rome for sure we will stay again in this hotel.",
                "We stepped off the train and walked past all the taxi drivers and touts and 3 minutes later we were in the reception of the Apollo Hotel. The receptionist was fluent in English and explained all the functions of the hotel in a clear and concise manner. We found breakfast to be a typical Continental style with bread , ham , eggs and jam . The coffee machine was excellent and we had plenty of time to sit and watch those around us eat and admire the views. The location was handy for the trams and the subway and we also walked to the Coloseum from the hotel and it was a pleasant 20 minute walk. For a 3 star hotel it was a pleasant experience and we will repeat again when next in Rome",
                "I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of May 2010. The hotel is at a very central location, within 10 minutes walk to Colosseum. But the room is very small. The shower place is tiny. I am a tiny person. But I could hardly turn myself when I am in the shower place. The bed is small and there are holes in the bed sheet. The breakfast is reasonable, but not exciting.",
                "Good location and bedrooms where a very nice size. Breakfast on the roof was a good variety and tasty food. The only bad thing I can say is that the geaser broke and we were without cold water on our 3rd day, but that could happen to anybody. Always somebody available at reception to help.",
                "We stayed at the Apollo in the end of July. What can I say?! Excellent hotel, friendly and helpful stuff, really good breakfast especially cakes and cappucino in a big cup. 7 minutes walk to Colloseum and 15 to Trevi Fountain. Nicely decorated spacious room with big bathroom. When I'm in Rome next time I would definetely stay in this Hotel!",
                "Stayed here for five nights back in October last year. Hotel is in a great location allowing you to walk to all the main attractions and explore, rather than having to rely on public transport. Breakfast of pastries, fruit and cereals etc being served on the roof terrace is a great way to start the day and there are plenty of restaurants near by. Really good friendly staff, very clean and tidy. Can't rate the Apollo enough, will definitely stay again."

As mentioned by other reviewers, close to the train station and colosseum, a bit distant to Campo de' Fiore, Piazza Navona, etc. Other comparable hotels were more expensive, so this was a very good value. Solid 3 star type of hotel.",
                "We found the Raffaello hotel to meet all our needs. The room was very comfortable and even enjoyed the jacuzzi shower once we worked out how to use it! The location is excellent, 5 mins away from the Termini and the Colosseum and an easy walk to all other tourist locations. Especially enjoyed the breakfast which offered an assortment of pastries, cold meats, bread, scrambled eggs, fruit and cake. Yum Yum! Amazing cappuccino's!",
                "Excellent location if you want to consider somewhere close enough to the main train terminus to walk to/back, and near the main tube line as well as the historic sites. The room was very pleasant no noise, and breakfast was simple but substantive. The hotel is also near to the large supermarket which may be used to make lunch to help reduce costs on the long days walks ahead. Great centre overall to base your visit",
                "We stayed at the Raffaello for three nights. The hotel is in a safe area and within walking distance to the Colosseum and the Termini. The rooms were very clean but the shower was incredibly small. If you are over 6 foot you probably won't fit. Personnel at the desk were very friendly and helpful with all our questions, directions, and requests for taxi service. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our 12 day travels throughout Italy, and included scrambled eggs daily. One day, however, a lady had her purse stolen while at the breakfast buffet. Someone must have come in from the outside, blended in with the crowd, and made off with the purse. If I return to Italy I would try to stay nearer the Campo de Fiori area for the night life and restaurants.",
                "We stayed five nights in the Hotel Raffaello in June. It was an absolute pleasure from the time we were checked in by Angelo until our departure. We had been conned by a taxi driver out of €90 for a €10 fare and of course were upset upon arrival. But Angelo was fabulous and we stayed in the room with the balcony, which was a great size. We were there to get engaged and as I had mentioned that to Angelo, within ten minutes of getting into our room a bottle of champagne was delivered up to us. The staff are absolutely lovely and I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know travelling to Rome. We hated to leave. To all of the staff in Hotel Raffaello, thank you for your kindness.",
                "Because of a mistake on my part, I had to cancel the day of our arrival at the last minute. After explaining my problem they took car of the change without charges. We cannot rave enough about the service from the front desk staff and the wonderful treatment by the two women in the breakfast room. The rooms were roomy and beyond clean. We think this is a hidden gem in Rome. Joe & Bev Wood Macungie PA",

                "Since I found this place 5 years ago, whenever I go to Branson, this is where we choose. It's away from the Branson chaos, beautiful quiet location and we always choose the lakeview condos. We don't have a boat so the marina down at Indian Point it perfectly located if we get in the mood to rent something. We're opposite the Silver Dollar City traffic if we want to go into town during the day and we're less than a mile away if we want to go to the park. It may be a bit of a drive if someone is intensely interested in going downtown or on the Strip a lot but the roads are good and it's not that big a deal for me! We always stay in the 2-bedroom condos, it's such a relaxing, roomy place to stay, so much better for us than staying on the Strip.",

We have our meals on the deck and love to sit out and relax and listen to the sounds of nature, read and listen to our \"tunes.\" Just one minor detail. We couldn't find the coffee. Everything else was there, handy and available, but no coffee. Hopefully next time it will be available.",

It's about 10 minutes past the main strip of Branson activities but it's worth the drive for the gorgeous views and lovely relaxing hotel. For the price and service level of the hotel, I did expect to have a mini fridge (empty or stocked) but our room type (king lakeview) did not have one. We took advantage of the great weather and hotel bar and had a glass of wine out on the deck. So lovely!",

Also room was right above delivery area which contributed to the noise. Overall not a very welcoming feeling at the Chateau. Coffee pot would not work and when I called to request another the woman at the front desk was rude and didn't seem to believe me. The doormen were unpleasant and wouldn't even smile, especially the one in the afternoon. I come to Branson often to visit family and for vacations and I'm sorry to say this will not be my choice of hotel in the future.",

From the description of the room we rented I thought it would be tight quarters. I was pleasantly surprised to find the atmosphere and facilities to be excellent. We stayed in a small suite, bedroom and a pull out couch. We had plenty of room and were very comfortable. The pull out couch was of excellent quality and slept better than some beds I have expereinced during travels. We stayed during the John Hagee ministeries event. The Chateau staff did an excellent job handling the large crowd staying at the hotel and those that came in for the sessions. The Chateau made a nice Spring Break destination for these Michigan travelers.",

                "Best hotel stay I've ever had! Every year my boyfriend and I celebrate our anniversary by having a hotel night, our normal hotel was unavaliable so we looked around and immediatly fell in love with the modern decor of these rooms. The location was amazing, having Netflicks avaliable to us as well was wonderful, and the hotel staff were very very nice! I think my boyfriend and I have found a new hotel for our future anniversaries! To sum up my experience: it was amazing!",
                "We got a decent deal online by having to show our concert ticket to Bon Iver at Massey Hall. The queen room was small but nice and recently updated, the hotel was in a great location about a ten minute walk to Queen street and only a few minutes from the GO station / Union. We paid a little extra for the \"Business Room\" which came with a bottle of water - although there was no fridge, a paper in the morning and Apple TV, which was a good to have after the show. The only faults: we were a disappointed when we asked downstairs for wine glasses on our way in, as we brought a bottle for after the show; and the pillows were a bit high/full for us - pretty minor. The breakfast down in the adjoining restaurant, Over Easy was great in the morning.",
                "Convenient location downtown. The staff were courteous and helpful. The room was modern and suited our needs for a one night rental.",
                "My girlfriend and I are staying here late November on an extended business trip. (for the first time) Before we have even stayed there, I can say I am more than satisfied with the service at this Hotel. I sent an email to the Sales Manager with a couple of questions about the hotel and he got back to me with polite answers\\suggestions in a timely manner. This is officially the first time I have ever written a review before I have stayed somewhere. Looking forward to our experience there.",
                "Location is perfect, just on Yonge and Wellington (close to Eaton centre for shopping and CN Tower Skydome for sightseeing). Althouigh, the breakfast was an extra cost (there is an over easy in the hotel), this was quite good value for money and a good way to start the day. The free wi-fi in the rooms was a God send. Room was nice and the shower was really good. I would definitely recommend people to stay here.",
                "stayed here for three nights. they are renovations going on at the moment in the lobby but don't let that put you off - we were on 2nd floor - newly renovated and didn't hear a thing. rooms are contemporary (new new blue woodedn floor) - clean rooms but be careful as bath in slippery - they have a bath mat for you to use. would have been nice if there were a few leaflets on site seeing in toronto - there was only a niagara leaflet. Must eat in Over Easy - restaurant just walk through hotel lobby - they do breakfast/lunch from 10am-4pm. the french toast and side of fresh fruit is magic. would recommend this hotel - hockey hall of fame is 5 minute walk - CN tower 15 mins and downtown shopping in yonge is a ten minute walk.",
                "I stayed over thr weekend and was VERY impressed with the quality of service(friendly staff) and the great room (really clean). I heard that they will be renovating in the near future and will make another reservation to see what the results are. Highly recommended",
                "Hotel Victoria is great as a base from which to see the city. It's on Yonge Street, bonus, and is reasonably priced. Things like CN Tower, Rogers Centre/Skydome, the Eaton Centre, harbourfront, Hockey Hall of Fame, Union station and Dundas Square are all between 5 and 20 minutes' walk. A list of good food options in the area would have the 'Richtree market restaurant' at the top (it's also one of the closest), nice 'takesushi' place around the corner, Baton Rouge closer to Dundas square. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. You don't choose hotel victoria because you want luxury, nice thick walls that block out most noise, or a view of anything but a brick wall (in our room anyway), but like i said it has friendly staff, is reasonably priced and is in a great location."

                "everything seemed first rate ...until i had to deal with the concierge...i think her name was christine... maybe she should work by herself...she seemed upset when my family requested reservations were asked to be made... but the rest of the property was outstanding... will stay again..just wouldnt use the conceirge again...",
                "Fabulous few days in Toronto!! Hotel is in a fab location to walk to the main shopping mall and the heart of Downtown. Hotel is very clean and the staff were lovely, very helpful and pleasant . The rooms were very clean and comfortable, and just right for a short city break, as we didn't spend much time in the room. The parking in the hotel was very very expensive $30 per night!!!!!! We had a car for 4 nights so worked out very expensive. Lovely breakfast though but again a little overpriced.",
                "I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels in central Toronto and settled on 1 king west. My spouse and I stayed in a superior studio suite and were extremely satisfied with our stay. I was attracted initially to the non-cookie cutter rooms typical in most hotels. The room was very modern with sophisticated looking furnishings, a very comfortable bed, nice walk-in shower and modern kitchenette. We were stationed on the 18th floor and did find the room a bit dark as our bedroom window was frosted over as it clearly faced another building in close proximity. We did not consider this an issue however because the room had so many other positives and the 'office' section of the room offered a view of the lake. My only disappointment was that there was no wi-fi (only hard-wired) so I was unable to use it.",
                "I've stayed at this hotel several times on trips to Toronto. It is in a great location. Walking distance to Eaton Centre, restaurants and theatres. Parking price is a little steep at 30$ a day but will pay around that amount anywhere in T.O. The room came well equiped - washer, dryer, kitchenette and king bed. Only negative in the room was the shower which tended to leak all over the bathroom floor and was so powerful it was an extremely uncomfortable experience. This could be room-specific as I did not have this experience on my previous stays. Overall, for the price, this is a great place to stay in downtown T.O.",
                "This was our third time staying at this hotel. What brings us back? Cleanliness, location (max 10 minute walk to Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre, Union Station, Historic District), friendliness, quality of room, and price. Also, the concierge is really helpful.",
                "Great Hotel. I stayed for 3nights in early July with my husband and 2 teenage sons sharing 1 room. Plenty of space, 2 TVs, Very clean. Nice bar area. Frendly staff and good position. For the money it is hard to fault it.",
                "I'd read the reviews and felt confident we'd get value....and we did. A nice clean hotel in a great location for site seeing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a short break to take in Torontos sites. Very good. My only small gripe is I would have liked bottled water available in the room. You need to buy your own but that's a minor personal irritation. Great hotel.",
                "This hotel was spacious, quiet and very clean. I would sum up the negative points of some other reviews by saying that this property is new and they are clearly still working on \"opening\" and getting their procedures in place. We had a glitch with our cards upon check-in and the staff upgraded us to a deluxe 2-room suite on the 44th floor with views on 3 sides. We moved to this hotel after having a bad experience at the Cosmpolitan, which is right across the street. We did not have any problems or costs involved with getting our car in and out, and another cool benefit is that the concierge staff has a fleet of vintage cars (Bentley, '60 Cadillac, Rolls) with drivers who will take you to various downtown sites for free (with an advance reservation)."

We found it to be small and the design a bit half hearted with a very strange shower! It's beautiful old building but could do with a bit of warmth and character. Having stayed elsewhere in Toronto I'd recomend the hotel a couple of blocks east.",
                "this was a great place to stay for the two of us. Hotel decor was fun and the staff were quite accomodating. There isalso a small restaraunt in this hotel that had great food However, for us it was located a bit off course in the sense that is is not subway convenient. Further, because this is an old historic hotel, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved. As the elevator is original to the hotel, it must be staff operated. At times we had to wait for someone to attend to this. Our other choice was walking 3 flights of stairs.",
                "No 'Big City Attitude' here! The Gladstone had really friendly and engaging staff. Rooms were unique and fun...no cookie cutter boxes with the same old crap. Even the elevator (circa 1900) was crazy and fun. Great food, music and decor and location are killer. Lots to do around the hotel. Try it out if you want something different!",
                "The Gladstone is a great escape in the city. It is well located to hang out on Queen St West as well as the theatre district and more mainstream shopping, and has much more charm than most hotels. Overall the rooms are interesting and fun, but the beds are the best part.",
                "Fantastic hotel, great drinks, food and the staff super nice and cool.... only complaints were that our left over margarita glasses weren't cleaned up, mattress wasn't great as it sagged in the middle and the shower felt like we were washing in a horizontal MRI machine! Opted not to say anything as we were only there for a couple of nights though would probably stay at the Drake Hotel next time we take a trip.",
                "The Gladstone Hotel is a great place in Toronto for so many reasons, aside from being a hotel. They have created unique spaces for musicians, artists, foodies and families...to showcase, perform and indulge. They support and promote local and organic eating ( by the way they have a FRY BAR...sweet potato, potato and taro too with tons of toppings). Harvest Wednesdays supporting field to table eating (yum) are not to be missed...and while you are there, you'll know why you need to try the Gladstone.",
                "I was very much looking forward to staying here, but I was quite disappointed. I was in town on business for a week, and my wife and child stayed with me the first day. The Gladstone is clearly more interested in being an arts/cafe/performance/bar venue for hipsters than a hotel. Details don't get addressed, the rooms are crazy small, and it's just not comfortable for any extended stay. I will try The Drake next time.",
                "I stayed in the Gladstone this June for 7 nights. Its a great hotel and represents great value in a really interesting area of the city. The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character...although very smart. Our room was small but adequate and well kept. The downstairs cafe serves great food, and while we were there there was live music and comedy every single night. The staff were very helpful and friendly and i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays. The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price."

The rooms are well kept, clean... and the beds are incredibly comfortable.. If I have one negative comment regarding this hotel it would be that the restaurant is very expensive..

The corridor had also an ice machine which I thought was very good idea, for those who like their cold water any time of the day. The breakfast in the hotel was also good, with a good choice of food. Newspapers were delivered to you in the morning and the staffs were very pleasant and helpful. The hotel also had a bar with a dancing floor and this was quite handy for us as we could drink and dance in. I will go there again if I ever go to Toronto and will definitely recommend it.",

I found the hotel to be very quiet even although it is a very busy hotel. The location of this hotel is great. It is a 2 minute walk to the Eaton Centre (which is great) and about 20 -25 minute walk down to Front Street for the CN Tower."

                "Great location for bar/ restaurant hopping on St Charles, nice and clean pool, fantastic steak house on site! Fun 24/7 bar next door for karaoke. Loved my stay for my birthday. Walk down to the Blind Pelican for drinks, 15$ taxi to quarter, great shopping on Magazine st.",
                "My daughter and I spend a weekend here while job hunting, school interviewing and house hunting. This was the perfect home base for all of our explorations. We have made many many trips to New Orleans but this was our 1st time staying outside of the Quarter. It was wonderful! The staff was amazing, so very nice. The rooms were spacious and well appointed, the beds very comfortable and everything upgraded and modern. Having the streetcar stop right out front made everything so easy. Would recommend this to anyone visiting this amazing city!!",
                "From the time we stepped out of our car to hand over our keys to the time we left we were treated like royalty. The porters, Kevin and Mr. Turner were exceptional and made us feel most welcome especially after travelling 11 hours in the car. We stayed in a studio with a king bed and full kitchen, dressing area and shower. All were very clean. We exchanged our time share and this was definitely a pleasant surprise. The Resort is in a residential area right on the St. Charles trolley line. We purchased a Jazzy Pass at Walgreens down the street and never needed our car.",
                "Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were large and clean and well appointed with tv, kitchenette, etc. Great shower. Even though this is a timeshare there was no pressure to buy. All staff went out of there way to be helpful..",
                "WOW - looking via the internet I was looking forward to staying at the Avenue Plaza. Too bad there was no information about them being timeshares. The location is great - right on the St. Charles streetcar line. But we didn't get fresh towels, the beds were not made up, the floors were dirty....NOT what you want to see when you are traveling, especially when you know there are so many hotels in NO that are way classier. Would not recommend staying here at all.",
                "This is a wonderful place to stay in a beautiful section of New Orleans. Fine dining and transportation all within walking distance. Well worth the money, I will stay here again!",
                "We stayed here during Mardi Gras and couldnt ask for a better location. St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door. The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building which is good because that means randoms cant go in. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. The room is equipped with a small kitchen which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, it's a good base to explore New Orleans with the trolley right outside your door. It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter...probably 30 minutes to 40 minutes. The rooms could be updated, but the staff was very helpful even during the stressful Mardi Gras time (super busy for them) It also had a very spacious and updated gym to burn those calories off from all the good food you eat in New Orleans",
                "Great hotel. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. The staff was very nice. The room was nicely appointed, with a refrigerator, stove, and coffee pot. The bathroom was small, but everything worked; it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less."

                "Very nice hotel Very nice hotel. The reception area is extremely nice. The rooms are also very nice with large flat screens although they are quite small.Very good breakfast. Very good location though as a result quite noisy.",
                "Had a great time! We splurged and booked two Bourbon Street balcony rooms for a post-graduation celebration with our two young adult daughters. Although the hotel itself is a little long-in-the-tooth, its location on lower Bourbon Street can't be beat. There are nicer, fancier hotels and inns nearby, but we chose the Royal Sonesta specifically for its location. Yes, it's noisy and you can hear music and rowdy crowds until late at night, but we anticipated this too. Bourbon Street was busier for an early June Monday and Tuesday night than I would have expected, but we had fun sitting on the balcony, throwing beads at the crowds who happened to walk by.",
                "Jazzfest Stay here for 8 nights and for the most part it was very enjoyable except for a few monir things that added up. For about 3-4 days the hot water was only luke warm, one day I went out and took off the privacy sign and by 3pm the room was not made up, had to call housekeeping and when I returned at 4pm, it still was not done, had to put in an angry second call to have the room done ASAP. Also one monring I had the privacy sign on and housekeeping still knocked on my door, lucky I was not sleeping.The location cannot be beat and service/staff is still very good.",
                "No one returns emails or calls...Upcoming Stay I have booked a room for an upcoming Conference-American College of Cardiology; I have sent emails to various managers at hotel inquiring what amenities are included for the room price of $300+/ SHOCKER - No one responds. I haven't even arrived there for my MARCH Conference, and I am feeling like this is a poorly managed hotel.",
                "Great hotel!! I have family in New Orleans so I am pretty familiar with the city...I have stayed in a good deal of places/areas of town. The Royal Sonesta, by far, offers the best location and experience. One of the three hotel bars to the GREAT restaurant for breakfast to the fabulous rooms, this place is a treasure. We had a courtyard room that opened up to the pool deck. BEAUTIFUL! And the price was right too!",
                "Overpriced Stayed there with my family Aug 1 to 4 2005. Good points - its on Bourbon Street. Bad points - its on Bourbon Street + everything else. Asked for a quiet room months ahead, we were given a room next to the elevator: noisy, lots of convention goers yelling up and down the corridor at 3 a.m. Parking is difficult - they have a garage (about $30/ day !!) but its small and spaces are tight. My wife had to go to ER whilst we were there, they didn't even know where the nearest hospital was ! Constant feeling that they wanted our cash but didn't want to provide anything like service in return. Avoid.",
                "Great place on Bourbon Street Stayed one night at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon Street. What a great place, very classy and you can't beat the location. Went in June so the rates were very inexpensive. Rooms were very clean and quiet. Definitely would stay there again. First Class."

                "My husband and I, as well as another couple reserved 2 rooms on the internet and were very happy with the accommodations. They were clean, comfortable, charming, centrallly located, and breakfast was a nice start to the day with yoghurt, cappuccino, coissants, cereal. The rooms were decorated with old world charm and the bathrooms were newly upgraded. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was walking distance to all of Venice. It is easiest to take a water taxi or the walk has many bridges and steps for you to navigate with your luggage. -Great value. Loved Venice and Locanda Sant'Agostin Loretta and Vincent",
                "The Locanda Sant'Agostin was a delight in every way. The hotel is a historic beauty with a pleasant surprise of a large spacious room and bathroom. The location was ideal; situated off a quiet plaza but within easy walking distance to our destinations.The staff was very friendly and helpful; their English speaking skills were somewhat limited but not problematic. Our stay was very pleasant and I highly recommend this hotel.",
                "A nice and friendly atmosphere. Everyone were very helpful in helping us with arrangement of a water taxi pickup early Sunday morning. It is located so you can easily (< 5 min) reach the places where the Venezians go out. I am sure that we will consider this place, the next time we go to Venezia.",
                "Locanda San Agostin is the most charming hotel; it is all about service and making sure the guests are comfortable. The staff are so helpful and so pleasant. We stayed in the apt nearby and found it spacious and clean, and it gave us a flavour of how Venetians live. The hotel is away from the main tourist drag but it is still in a great location, not far from the water-ferry station and Rialto,and quite close to a couple of great restaurants.",
                "We stayed in the apartment next to the hotel which was spacious, comfortable and clean and a great price for Venice. Breakfast next door at the hotel was lovely and the breakfast lady is very warm and friendly. The staff at reception could not have been more helpful, booking us tickets to a concert, recommending places to visit and restaurants to eat. Would definitely come back and stay again.",
                "The hotel was ideally located in the centre of Venice but in a nice quiet situation. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the hotel was spotlessly clean. I would certainly recommend this hotel and when I return to Venice will look no further.",
                "We stayed in the Locanda Sant'Agostin in January '06, we were very impressed with the quality and friendliness of the service we received. Our room was very quiet, if not a little cold, however I think the Venetian's are a little more hardy when it came to the -C temperatures we experienced. January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! Breakfast was basic continental style, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience Venice, you really can walk anywhere from the Hotel, the Rialto Bridge and St Marks are only a few minutes walk away. A brilliant holiday - thank you Locando Sant'Agostin we'll be sending our parents your way next year!"

Have to climb 4 floors to go our room, luckily the doorman helped us with the luggages. Stayed here one night and they stored our luggage for free.",
                "If you are cruising, this a great location. We walked from cruise terminal to Piaza Roma. The hotel is visible from the Piaza. You can get to the airport by bus, cab, or water taxi practically from the front door. The room was small but had a nice view. We left the window and shutters open and it still was not too noisy, although there is activity going on almost all night. Small but usable elevator, which you don't always get. The location and ease of travel made it worth the price.",
                "This is a good hotel, cold air conditioning, warm and friendly staff, and only two bridges from train station and one bridge from Water busses and Piazzaie Roma. They have tables with an awning outside their front door so you can sit and have some wine and enjoy Venice. A good restaurant is right next door and the staff will tell which ones in the area to avoid.",
                "This hotel was very nice. The room was quite beautiful, very large by Venice standards, with a canal view and good breakfast. The only complaint is that it is near the end of a vaparato route, and too far to walk at night from San Marco (unless you are actually familiar with the streets and alleys of Venice.) The restaurant, Brucinellis, in the same building was not so great. The bass was very disappointing, and I believe they refill the water bottles with tap water.",
                "My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Hotel Olimpia over the new year holiday for four nights. It is everything it claims to be and it looks just like the photos on the website. The front desk staff was very helpful and the dining room staff was great too. The Hotel is located about a minutes walk from the vaporetto station. You should buy an extended vaporetto pass if you are going to be in town for a stretch of time. The railway station was a short three minute walk away, and St. Mark's Square took about 1 hour at a leisurely pace to reach.",
                "We stayed here for three nights prior to our cruise, the hotel is very conveniently located transportation wise from the airport and pier. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very good. The only note is that the shower was actually smaller than the one on the ship. Great hotel, I would stay there again and recommend it to friends.",
                "Hotel is quietly situated, although well located for the trains, buses and vaporetto. It is very clean and comfortable with friendly and efficient staff. Excellent selection for breakfast. I developed a health problem whilst in Venice and the reception staff could not have been more helpful and supportive in assisting me to resolve the matter. I would certainly stay at this hotel if we return to Venice. Our only criticism would be that the room was a little on the small side but as we spent a great deal of time sightseeing it did not affect our enjoyment of our stay.",
                "A 3 euro ticket from the airport takes you to Plaza da Roma in 15 mins, you can see the hotel as you get off the bus, A 2 minute walk up steps along small bridge and down steps brings you to Hotel Olimpia. We arrived at Marco Polo at 9p.m by 10p.m we had checked in and were eating supper overlooking canal by hotel-magical.Rooms very pretty, not big, but comfortable.Breakfast plentiful. Very convenient for leaving luggage there when checking out.Would definetly stay there again, not cheap though."

                "Highly recommed We started our honeymoon on Waikiki beach and even though the Outrigger reef was under some construction, their hospitality and kindness made up for it. However we did have an Ocean view room which was near the construction but we asked to move to an Ocean front and they allowed us for a minor upgrade charge. Overall, I was very happy with the Outrigger, their dining, their hospitality and especially happy with the free gifts they gave us for staying there. Everything a hotel should do when you are trying to enjoy your honeymoon.",
                "demolition site six nearby buidings are being demolished to make way for new timeshare apartments which makes relaxing by the pool uncomfortable .The noise from the breakers can be heard all over the hotel,so unless you like taking your holiday in the middle of a large building site, give this hotel a miss until 2007 when the projct is due for completion.",
                "Poor service We had a very rough start to our stay in this hotel. We had booked a king room and were taken to a cramped room with no view and one double bed. When we complained, the staff said they had no rooms available that fit our confirmed reservation. They offered to give us a comparable room at a related hotel down the street, which turned out to be off the beach and much less nice than this hotel. We returned to reception to tell them the room was unacceptable and were eventually upgraded to a king room at the Outrigger Reef with a partial ocean view. Why they didn't do this first if they didn't have a regular king room I will never know, but it made us very grumpy to wait nearly two hours to get a room after a very long flight.The room was clean, but nothing special. It had a small outdoor patio, but overlooked the pool and many other patios, which made it very loud and not at all private.We would not stay here again.",
                "Loved the Outrigger Reef! We stayed at the Outrigger for 4 nights on our honeymoon in October. They upgraded us to an ocean front room and brought us a bottle of champaign on our first night! This hotel is right on the beach and has 2 restuarants right on the beach in addition to a great place to eat at the pool along with the sports bar at the pool. We never had a problem getting a chair at the pool. We spent most of our days going back and forth from the ocean to the pool - there is also a little sandwich, ice cram and smoothie shop right next door that we would eat lunch at on the beach that is pretty cheap. It is on the far end of Waikiki, which we liked cause you are close to the action but also have some quiet. We will definitly stay here again when we return to Oahu.",
                "A Fantastic Time!       Outrigger Reef Hotel",
                "Loved the island- The Outrigger Reef was a very nice hotel. I did not however like the enforced valet parking. I was lead to believe we had to valet, but we could have parked on the upper level on our own, and still paid the $13 per day. From what I understand, it could have been worse, some hotels charged as much as $18 per day for parking. There are so many hotels, restaurants and shopping in this small area of Wikiki, that there is no parking space, so you pay dearly for having a car. Every place we went there were also tour busses that would do the same routes, but we did it at our leisure, and stayed at each site as long as we wanted. The next trip will be to another quieter less populated island. But the Island was absolutely breathtaking, expensive but breathtaking.",
                "Handicap access We stayed at Outrigger Reef for 7 days in mid-May 2003 and would go back in a heart beat. I am blind/visually impaired and my sighted companion is wheelchair confined. We booked a handicapped access room and though a little small, the roll-in shower with bench was most comfortable and the room clean and airy with a balcony overlooking the pool and a partial ocen view.Breakfast each day was a delight pool side, with attentive courteous service. Ate dinner several nights in the hotel dining rooms and were very pleased.. Found an Italian restaurant across the street and dined there 2 nights as a change of pace. Tour amenities in the lobby were helpful, and the bell desk helped arrange transportation to Pearl Harbor and my Korean War vessel the Mighty USS Missouri. All in all a most enjoyable trip and the Outrigger Reef staff contributed greatly.Aloha!"

                "Nice stay This was a pretty nice hotel. The location was great and very convenient. The amenities were nothing fancy, but definitely adequate. We got a balcony that overlooked the city and ocean and a sizeable bathroom; I couldn't really ask for more. This is definitely not a luxury palace, but I doubt anyone booking this hotel expects that!",
                "Would NEVER Stay There Again I booked this Queen as part of a package from Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. The flight (Delta) was packed but ok. The room at the Queen REEKED of mold. We couldn't get another room, they claimed to be 100% full (actually, they told us they always overbook 3-5%).I took apart the air conditioner, cleaned out a bunch of black fungus/mold and bought a can of Lysol at ABC store for $8.It helped a little, but not much.I called Pleasant, they claimed they couldn't help me and that I was better off at the counter.If you stay here, remember you're paying $50/night in a $150 neighborhood and that the facility is old, moldy, overbooked, and that they don't have much for customer service.By the way, I think Pleasant Holidays is off my list too becase of their complete lack of support.",
                "Getting Pretty Bad Liike every one has said , the location  view are wonderful , but then there's your room and the slow elevators. The rooms need a new face lift bad and the bathrooms are getting gross, I went to have breakfast with my family, and after waiting over 20 minutes for a elevator they where leaving the restraunt by the time I got there. And the tile around the pool is VERY SLIPPERY, my grandchildren fell many times. I would recommend this hotel only if it's all you can afford and you want to be close to the beach.",
                "Can't Recomment This hotel is in need of a big makeover, standard rooms are really small, seems some motels have better rooms than their standard rooms. Service was good, but thats about it for this hotel.",
                "A Good Deal Stayed for 4 nights and had a really good stay. Friendly, helpful staff. Tour/Activities staff in lobby very knowledgeable. Poor points are very limited parking and having to go to basement to get a pool towel from Housekeeping versus poolside on 3rd floor. The AC units chill your room quickly. Breakfast buffet good deal for the money and their dinners are just as good as any other restaurant. Excellent location (beach, zoo, aquarium, shopping, etc) and easy to find. Rooms are dated but clean and larger than you'd expect for the price. I would definitely stay there again and plan to do so!",
                "Wonderful Value - Good for GLBT Customers If you are used to the Ritz-Carlton and the W Hotel, then this place is not for you. But, if you want a wonderful bargain right in the heart of Waikiki, this is great! And if you are a GLBT customer, you are right next door to Hula's and across the street from Queen's Surf Beach. I would definitely stay again. I got a great deal too. Stay 3 nights and get the 4th night free.",
                "great hotel good value We stayed at Queen Kap for 11nights to the 09 sept 04. It was great we requested an ocean view studio with kitchenette. The room was on the 8th floor had a view of diamond head, beach, pool and zoo!! It was old but clean and very comfortable, and reasonably priced with every 5th night free and free buffets thrown in everyday too! Check their websites for specials. We will be staying there again its old but good and staff are friendly but request a room with a view and pay the extra! Mahalo"

Next morning, the shower came alive and flew of the wall like a firemans hose, scallding each of us and having finally sorting this dangerous problem, we arrived 10 minutes late for breakfast and staff wouldnt serve us. staff then kept us waiting half an hour to check out with no real apoligy for our inconvieniences.staff very laid back and unintrested. All in all a big dissapointment. Scallding cobra shower very dangerous.BE WARNED",

They then try and hold most of it back when you are leaving saying it is a local tax. We paid fully for our trip through a travel agent in UK before travelling so if the hotel have a problem with that they should take it up with them. Kick up a stink like we did and they will back down though. It makes you wonder how many people have been conned with this trick?",
                "This hotel is exceptional. For a 3 star Euro hotel the rooms are huge, the views of the canal (Herengeraacht) outside are atmospheric, the location, despite being very quiet is a pleasant 10 minute stroll to Dam Square, and only 5 minutes to Anne Franks House. The staff were very helpful and friendly despite the fact we turned up at gone midnight a little wiped from our day in Amsterdam. For the price this hotel really is head and shoulders above its peers, which in Amsterdam can be very seedy. Always stay here when in the `Dam.",
                "For this trip to 'the dam' we wanted to be a bit more central, and we hit jackpot with this hotel. Right next to a canal, its around 5 mins walk to Dam square, and the same to Jordaan or the Nine Little Lanes. Leidsplein and other more interesting parts are also just a short walk away. The hotel itself is ok, it has a grand entrance hall with a reception desk staffed by smiley staff members. The room was quite small, but large enough to cope with for just a few nights, but as the city was so close we hardly spent any time in there anyway. The staff were helpful, offering advice about what to see and do, and happy to look after cases after we checked out and went to get some lunch. Would stay here again.",
                "The hotel is in a very good location, just off a main street in central Amsterdam, on a quiet canal street. It is a 3 star hotel which may account for the stained carpeting, thin towels, and some snooty reception staff. The breakfast, although a reasonable price, was consistently out of items, had stale pastries and funny tasting eggs. Some of the rooms are tiny, so try to request a large room, if the staff will indulge your request.",

                "We spent 2 nights at the mint hotel/ doubletree by hilton. All I can say is that the rooms were suberb. Very friendly staff at reception and breakfast was a delight. Unfortunately, room service needs to improve as our expectations were not managed. Food took longer to arrive and had to keep chasing. Also we were told that the kitchen is closed after 45mins of putting our order. However, the rooms and freindliness of the reception/ breakfast team make up for it. Extremely good value for money and will stay there again.",

The location is very good, being right next to Central Station, but can be a little far from some of the tourist spots such as the Museums, Leidseplein and Jordaan. The hotel itself is very well presented, and staff very polite. However, on one day we left the room at around 10am and returned at 4.30pm to find that the room had not yet been cleaned (even though we had left the 'clean me' tag on the outside of the door). We had to ask at reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned, and over and hour and a half later it eventually was. The towels that we were promised immediately upon complaining turned up over 2 hours later. At no point were we offered anything to appease us, staff simply apologised and were ineffectual, although polite. This was disappointing, as apart from this, the stay was extremely pleasant.",

The Staff were very helpful & friendly, had made a note on booking form was our Wedding Anniversary + my birthday received a bottle of wine in room, also complimentary Continental breakfast each day. Hotel very central, more hotels being built nearby so maybe some disruption? Although we didn`t have any problems."

                "Our room was very nice, and the service was excellent. We felt like this was a real bargain, especially regarding the location in the center of \"the quarter\", yet it was easy to find. The room was clean and well arranged. Valet parking is really required.",
                "We stayed at the Hotel le Marais for four nights and loved it. This modern, boutique hotel was clean and well-maintained. The beds were heavenly! The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall, leaving huge puddles on the floor, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess. The staff was extremely helpful, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. The best part of the hotel is that it is in the heart of the French Quarters. This visit was all of our first times in Nola. Being able to walk to key landmarks, check out local art galleries and antiques, and grab a beignet was a huge plus! Other hotel perks: free drinks per guest, free bottled water in the room, 15% off our stay, and chocolates and ginger snaps in the lobby.",
                "Stayed here over Memorial Day weekend 2012. I think this hotel is a steal if you catch it on an off-season weekend when the prices are lower. In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. Love the courtyard and pool -- very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: there's no housekeeping after midnight, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise the service was outstanding, especially Shawn at the front desk. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.",
                "Beautifully remodeled hotel in the perfect location. Very clean and very quiet - unbelieveable since it's only 1/2 block off Bourbon Street. The staff was excellent, the bar was a nice quiet retreat and the courtyard is charming. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to NOLA!",
                "This hotel is in the very heart of the French Quarter. It is new, clean, and has good facilities. WiFi, breakfast, and a very well equipped business centre was free (normally charged for at other hotels), so I felt like I had good value for money. The staff were friendly and helpful. As this hotel has only just opened, there were a few very small teething problems in the area of service, but I am sure this will be sorted out in no time. I would definitely stay there again.",
                "3 couples - friends for 30+ years, vacationing together for the first time. The hotel was fabulous - the rooms were clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable. The pool area was lovely and a wonderful way to end the evening. The location - perfect walking distance to everything. The staff pleasant and professional. My husband and I had been to the French Quarter 15 years earlier and we begged our friends to share this experience with us. Thank you for making this a most memorable experience for us.",

Everyone from the front desk to the general manager made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Well done!!!!"

                "Buyer Beware Stayed during a convention. It is as kindly as I can put it a dump. The rooms were horrid, poorly kept and bad condition. The mattresses, boxsprings and pillows looked as if they were purchased from a Katerina Auction. The service was comical and even though it states they serve breakfast they only serve coffee and pastries. Could not wait to check out.",
                "Welcoming and friendly staff, elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel, from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, with antique brick walls and elaborate, lush curtains. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the amazing staff), was the location. It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions (the steamboat tours, downtown New Orleans, The French Quarter, etc).When I return, I would definitely go back to this hotel.",
                "Had a Great Stay Just wanted to say that I had a great time at the Ambassador in New Orleans The rooms were great, housekeeping was great, very polite and Dave Smith the room manager was excellent with everything I needed. Hope to go back soon. Thanks",
                "Got Bugs??? The room service advertised is a joke...unless you like greasy Mexican food. The cleaning in the rooms was horrible; barely vacuumed or dusted in almost 2 weeks of staying there and the bathroom was just barely cleaned everyday. The management is lacking and not too interested in customer service. My roommate was chewed up by some bugs in her bed and was left with huge welts that itched and oozed. Since it was booked through Expedia.com, there was nothing that they would do except take off the mandatory $4.95 phone surcharge (although that was pretty cool, since all local and continental long distance charges were included in that).It was a big disappointment from start to finish.",
                "Great spot, great rate, great effort! Just returned from stay for French Quarter Fest. As we arrived, a bus was dropping off a full load of European students to stay at the hotel. Despite the sudden rush, we were checked in cheerfully and quickly. Everyone went out of their way. Location is great for getting to (or away from) Quarter craziness or Garden District, and Warehouse area has its own charm and eateries. Room was comfortable and quiet, if a bit dark. Bandito's off the lobby great for delicious breakfast with no wait (!) or tequila any time. We'd recommend the Ambassador to anyone traveling to NoLa for biz or pleasure...",
                "Great old hotel in a great location I stayed at the Ambassador a week ago and had a wonderful time! I did have one of the infamous windowless rooms (the hotel is an old renovated warehouse of sorts) but the ambiance of the authentic New Orleans decor (exposed brick, high ceilings, wood floors) made it almost seem like being in old France. The hotel is located close to everything there is in New Orleans and a close stumble to Bourbon St. I found the valet staff to be prompt and friendly even though they were busy and the front desk staff was quick to attend to any request with a smile. I am definetly staying at this hotel next time I am in New Orleans, and I am curious to see how wonderful the renovations will turn out!",
                "AMBASSADOR HOTEL, NEW ORLEANS Please be advised when booking at this hotel to request a room with a window. Ours did not have one and the door into the room was the only way out. Had there been a fire my husband and I would have been dead. I am wondering how these rooms ever passed code. The inexpensive rates and free parking were not bargain enough for the potential danger.",
                "Once is Too Much If you enjoy fraternity house decor, you'll love the Ambassador. No extra charge for the beat-up furniture, lightless broom closet rooms and paper thin walls. Hotels like the Ambassador don't count on repeat business. There are much better hotel options in New Orleans."

The cheerful, personal touch and helpfulness of the staff (particularly Salvatore the concierge who gave great tips re restaurants) made our stay an absolute pleasure. The view of the river Arno from our terrace was beautiful and the location was just right - a short walk from the centre but far enough away from the attractions so as to be quiet.The room was quite small but comfortable and clean and had a nice bathroom and a great shower.There was free internet access in the hotel lobby.We would highly recommend the Hotel River and would definitely stay there again next time we visit Florence.",
                "Nice and quiet Incredible little hotel away from the noise of Florence, but walking distance of only 10 minutes to city center. Great sized rooms and beautifully decorated. Very clean with decently sized bathrooms for Europe. Beds were very hard. Breakfast served beautifully and elegantly with many choices, based on basic Italian breakfast of pastries, cold cuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs (with cute little cups and spoons), fruit and real coffee! Very small staff works hard to meet every need. Great place to have a drink before dinner in the lobby or on the rooftop balcony with view of the Arno.",

Rooms were large; bathroom was large compared to other places we stayed in Italy, and the A/C really worked! The staff was helpful and accomodating with maps, directions, restaurant recommendations, taxis, and laundry service. There is a booth in the hotel lobby with a computer with internet access. Don't miss gelato at Vivolo, near San Croce.",

Polite and helpful staff.A short walk (or inexpensive bus ride) to the historic attractions.The knowledgeable manager will tell you which buses go where as well as sell you the tickets. He also directed us to the shop selling the gorgeous room fragrance that was in our room.Standard breakfast in an enclosed terrace or in the elegant lower breakfast room. My only crticiscm is of the coffee, because I just prefer a pot at the table.",

The room was pretty and clean, with a nice view of inner courtyard. Staff were friendly and very helpful, and we were close to all the main sights. The hotel balcony was lovely to sit around and watch the world go by and see the river below. I would recommend this as a good value, better than 3-star hotel and would visit again.",

It is located across the street from the Arno in the San Croce area. Our daughter and I liked the location because this area of Florence was very clean and was away from the main hubbub of the city. There is a bus stop very close to the hotel. We arrived by train and took the number 13 to the hotel and the number 12 took us back to the train station.

They made us wait while they checked people in and out before giving us the insurance forms to fill out and made us wait once again while they copied the forms for us. They never apologized and basically treated us like we didn't exist. Stay away from this one - there's plenty of hotels in Florence.",

The first room we were given was tiny  the a/c didn't work. The room they gave us next was handicap-accessible and was much larger, with a huge bathroom. The bathroom, however, had no put-down space at all  we had to move a small table from the bedroom into it. The neighborhood is very seedy and we were uncomfortable walking around there at night.

We were in a room with 2 beds, fridge, & micro(we were in room 403), room with views of Clark St. As always it was a great stay, staff very friendly, and willing to help in any way possible. If your not a continental b-fast kind-of-person, I would suggest The Golden Nugget one block south of Diversey on Clark.",
                "This old Days Inn is in the heart of Lincoln Park and a short walk to Boys Town.The hotel was clean and the free breakfeast was a big hit. My only complait are the bathrooms. Time to upgrade! They all have this 3 inch step up which is just great to trip over at 3 am in the dark. Other then that this is a nice hotel.",
                "Cheapest decent hotel in Chicago that I could find. Nice large room which was pretty modern looking considering the age of the building. Appreciated the free WiFi and the fact that you have to swipe your key to get on the elevator or stairs- extra security (though somehow the pizza delivery guy was able to get up to our room, must have an agreement with the hotel.) Street noise didn't bother me too much. Breakfast was great, although the room was a little cramped. The only complaint I have is that its hard to pull up to the front of the hotel to get valet parking ($22/24 hours) Great hotel.",
                "I stayed here by myself the night before a group tour and got a single room, which came with a double bed. The sheets are soft and there four pillows on the bed! Awesome. The room is perfect for one or two people. The area is great, although not serviceable by the train, it has buses to the city. The area itself is really upbeat, with a young crowd. Great little shops, restaurants and bars. I'd stay here again for sure if I were in Chicago. It's a nice alternative to the large downtown hotels.",
                "The staff at this hotel were extremely gracious and went out of their way to welcome me. I arrived early and the staff had a room cleaned and ready for me promptly. Property is located right in the heart of Lincoln Park and there are numerous dining and nightlife options at the property doorstep. I will definitely return to this property. The Days Inn brand gets a serious upgrade in my mind with properties of this character.",
                "This was my first trip to Chicago and Days Inn made it even better! It is a great bargain especially for the location. The hotel was clean, the staff was so darn nice, the free bfast was mmm soo good- the muffins were amazing, fresh squeezed juice, and even make your own waffles. The only complaint is the drain in the shower wasn't working as smoothly as it should have been. I can't see how anything could go wrong here and even if it did, front desk was just so ncie!",
                "We booked this hotel for a girl's trip to Chicago. I booked solely on written reviews....and boy were we impressed!!! For the price, this hotel is PERFECT!!!! The beds were great, rooms were very clean, breakfast was the best....waffles...YUMMY...and the staff was so helpful and friendly!!!! Great location to public transportation. Highly recommend this property!!!!!",
                "I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 15 years. It is quiet, clean, moderately priced, and very conveniently located near several bus lines. Clark Street, on which it is located, is a major shopping street, and there is parking at the nearby Century Mall. I have found the staff to be friendly and helpful."

The location can't be beat, of course, and the rooms are beautiful, especially the spacious marble baths. The fluffy down duvets are delightful too. The ever gracious staff is what sets The Talbott apart from the rest. You will be warmly greeted at the door by the bellmen, then experience the same personal touch at the front desk and the concierge desk. People who are happy doing their job and personally connected to your excellent experience, that's the big deal. I am attaching a photo of Gene at the concierge desk, just one of the good friends you will also make at The Talbott hotel!!!",

                "The Talbott is a great place to stay. It is a luxury boutique in the heart of the Gold Coast, easily within walking distance of Michigan Avenue, State Street, and Navy Pier. The staff is exceptionally friendly. They provide twenty-four-hour room service, concierge service, and the front desk staff and waitstaff are even cheerful late at night. The rooms are modern, well decorated, and comfortable. They feature flat-screen sattelite televisions, ihome alarm clocks, and many other conveniences one would expect from a luxury hotel, without the sameness of the chains.",

The staff were extremely courteous and friendly, the rooms were excellent, and the service efficient. It is a great location, and we would recommend it to our friends.",
                "My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott. The room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. Linens and towels first-class. Free Wi-Fi in the room. The location is terrific, just one block to Michigan Avenue. We will stay here on future visits.",
                "We stayed 5 nights at the Talbott which was in easy walking distance of the Hancock Tower, Millenium park, Sears Tower etc. Staff were friendly, and helpful. Menu was varied but limited. Numerous Restaurants nearby, avoid Gibsons as very expensive. We had large comfortable Room with walk in wardrobe, well equipped bathroom with his and hers toilet rolls and basins. Not cheap, but central and not as expensive as the Water Tower next door.",
                "In a word - NOISY. A new hotel is being constructed out back. They start at 8 a.m. sharp and don't end until late at night. Every Day. I'd wait until it's done before staying there. If you only need one bed, they can move your room to the front of the hotel where it's not as bad. If you need more than one bed, though, you're out of luck. The hotel is nice, restaurant has very good food and otherwise the stay was fine."

A Singapore sling (comes in several flavours) is 26 SGD plus 17 percent. The place is normally crowded, yes there is even a queue at the door at times. The place is full of tourists, Americans are there in large numbers. The toilets around the corner are totally out of character with the Raffles hotel in particular and Singapore standards in general. Hence try to avoid them. The hotel is very neat, the beautiful reception is closed to non-guests and the restaurants of top class. The Long bar is there for tourists and the profit only. It could as well be closed as it no longer has anything to do with the hotel as such.",
                "What’s not to like about the Raffles Hotel Singapore? The staff is almost perfect in their service and attentiveness. The rooms are exquisite. The hotel is gorgeous and a nice oasis in the midst of an urban landscape. It’s a beautiful place with an appropriately high-class staff that gives excellent recommendations for restaurants, tourist information, and navigating the city. We think everyone deserves to stay here at least once in his or her lifetime.",
                "Very disappointed with the afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room. The sandwiches had been made for hours and the bread was very dry. Not much selection of other food. Must say the service was excellent and all staff at the hotel were pleasant. We stayed at the Fullerton Bay Hotel and are sorry now that we did not partake of their aftenoon tea service, but Raffles being Raffles, we thought it was going to be \"the tops\".",

Other than that, the rest of our stay was wonderful and we'd surely come .",

I also did the Tour East Tour that included a Singapore Sling at Raffles, I opted out of the Singapore Sling for $29.50,Thought it was over priced. I can understand some one who says having the Singapore Sling as a memorable experience, to note as having done it. Tick it off as been there done that. I can say the same as having just experiencing the aura of The Long Bar and treading on peanut shells as an experience in itself. Can recomend to anyone thinking of doing these tours or others with Tour East. Very professional group Thank you for a wonderful holiday."

                "As a regular business traveller to Singapore I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La. Great service, attention to detail and the ever present taxi-hailer - make it feel like coming home. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with quiet aircon and welcoming tea and fruit. Room service is of a good standard and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore.",
                "What a wonderful atmosphere and a great room for a great price. The breakfast buffet was out of this world. The room was gorgeous. Service was exceptional.",
                "Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. Excellant service and staff. Rooms are large and standard of cleanlines is very high. Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity. Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area, however I believe the hotel also offer a free shuttle service. Hotel has a gym and swimming pool. Buffet breakfast was great, with a huge choice and fresh products. As my departure flight was at 11pm, the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club, with towels etc provided for shower. Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure.",
                "You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and the Shangri la is up there amoungst the very best, From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm. This is a word \"calm\" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool. Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.",
                "Fantastic hotel - wonderful rooms, great beds, fruit in the room every day, extensive gym....could not have asked for more. A few minutes walk from Orchard Road so when I wanted to do a bit of shopping it was close but far enough away to not hear the noise. The gym and LINE restaurant were WONDERFUL. I will definitely stay here again - perfect for my business trips to Singapore.",
                "All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way to mitigating against the high cost. The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best I've had and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at such a wonderful hotel.",
                "We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. The rooms are spacious and luxurious and the staff are very attentive, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.",
                "The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, the absolute friendly and warm staff members knew our name from the first day. In the Lobby all Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi... Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. Rooms are beautiful and large, garden and pool-site are very relaxing, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne... Thanks a lot, Achem!!"

                "The only complaint I have with this hotel is that the buffet breakfast, which was included in the price of the room, was lousy. Watery scrambled eggs, pay extra for a cappuccino, bacon that died two days ago - apart from that though, a great hotel with terrific service. A short walk to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street. A good diner/grill/bar across the road. Despite the breakfasts, I'd stay there again.",
                "Staff was very helpfull with directions around the city. Location was fine , We had no problems with anyone in the area despite what other people have said in their reviews.",
                "I took a quick 3 day weekend trip to Toronto (my first trip there) with friends to see a ballgame and the Hockey Hall of Fame and take a quick tour of the city. The staff at the Grand was very friendly, helpful and attentive. Feeling welcome is very unusual in todays mega-chain hotels, but the Grand was top notch in that respect. Any flaws that the Grand may have vanish thanks to the staff and many complimentry features. Excellent free breakfast buffet, nice indoor pool and jacuzzi, two rooftop jacuzzis and sitting areas (make sure you use them on warm summer night!) and free gym. Underground parking is expensive, $19.00 per night, but I was not charged. The neighborhood is very colorful, but if you want a sanitized version of a city, stay on the Las Vegas strip. You will feel safe anywhere you walk in Toronto, and Toronto is a city that should be walked to be experienced.",
                "We were satisfied with our stay at this hotel. The service was very good, the hotel was clean, the breakfast was decent, and the rooms were just fine. The hotel is in a not great area, but I felt safe, nonetheless. A bit outside of the city center, but the hotel itself is nice and it is close to a subway station, as well as a trolley line. Don't bother renting a vehicle, you won't need it! Also, the hotel offers a shuttle to sites within the downtown district. The swimming pool is very nice, and the roof space is very nice with plenty of seating and the hot tubs were great. The staff were attentive and very gracious. I would definitely stay here again.",
                "Liked the hotel, the rooms, the pool, the hot tub on the roof. Location close to everything you need, but somehow the blocks surrounding the Grand Hotel are not the nicest area. I didn't feel safe there.",
                "We stayed at the Grand hotel for 2 nights, and it was great. Our Junior Suites were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accomodating. The location was excellent - steps away from the Eaton Centre and great shopping. We had a lovely complementary breakfast each morning including both hot and cold food. Complementary internet access was very useful in keeping in touch with family. We pretty much had the beautiful pool, whirpool, and locker room facilities to ourselves - also very clean. I will definitely be staying at the Grand hotel again.",
                "We got a great deal online for a nice room with a beautiful view -- the small suite with a foldout couch was perfect for our family of four. The hotel staff was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful, with lots of tips for getting around. The location is not excellent -- it's on the outskirts of downtown, and the neighborhood is a bit scary even for those of us from other large cities -- but the hotel provides a free shuttle, and we were able to walk to restaurants and shopping without a problem. The pool room was hot and overchlorinated but adequate to calm down the kids before dinner. All in all, a nice stay, and we'd go back.",
                "I have just returned home from my Canadian Getaway. The hotel is fantastic and we have never experienced such incredible service before. Our room always looked spectacular, and the front desk staff was always extremely helpful. We ate a couple meals at the hotel which were both great. I would recommend this restaurant and hotel to anyone travelling into Toronto or that even live in Toronto! I've visited Toronto many times and love the city, yet i've never wanted to stay in the hotel so much before. The roof top was beautiful at night or in the day. If you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to Toronto then this Hotel is an absolute must."

                "The service was impecabble! But the room.... The rooms are very small and DIRTY. You can see dust everywhere!!",
                "This review is a little late I know, however we have beeen constantly travelling since our stay in early Sept. I note all the other reviews regarding dated property and poor hotel standards and I also note the constant apologies from Hotel Management, however with so many poor reviews why don't they fix the problems, then they wouldn't have to keep apologing. I won't repeat all the comments from so many poor reviews other than so say, that was our experience as well. For the price, poor hotel, poor value for money, there are better options in Toronto.",
                "We stayed at this hotel on 9th Aug for three nights..It is superbly located in the tourist area of Toronto. We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived in the hotel.We stayed on the gold floor with breakfast included this was outstanding we would highly recommend this hotel for a truly fantastic first class hotel in Torronto.",
                "Stayed one night because of the hotel's convenient Porter Airline shuttle available outside the hotel's door. Staff was attentive and helpful, however the lines for the Concierge were long. Lovely restaurants in the hotel and there is an underground mall under the hotel. The hotel is a little expensive and parking is very expensive but the location is terrific. Rooms are small but comfortable. Hotel is large and hallways are very long. Only complaint, typical of expensive hotels, you must pay $16 for internet access.",
                "I read many negative reviews after I made a non-refundable reservation for two nights. SO...I took all the negative comments to heart and when I checked in, I specifically asked for a refurbished, quiet room. Supposedly there are some rooms with antiquated furniture and lots of noise, I waited a few hours to check in, but the room was very nice, small, but nice flat screen tv, modern furniture, comfortable king-size bed and no noise even though we were near the elevator. I also got a coupon for free appetizer and $50 food and beverage credit. Everything in the hotel is expensive and Canada has a ton of tax on everything but the food was good and the place is gorgeous but be aware, parking was $42 a night. Absurd.",
                "Located in heart of downtown near financial district and train station. Historic hotel with grand lobby and lots of atmosphere. Rooms small but clean and comfortable. Service good, excellent concierge. Can be pricey, try to get a deal online, worth about 150 to 250 per night depending on time of year and size of room you get.",
                "Stayed at Royal York for 3 nights at start of a trans Canada tour. The lobby etc. of the hotel are very grand and imposing and well worth seeing, Our room was the smallest one of any of the hotels we stayed at during trip, although it had the normal two large beds, there was not a lot of room around them. Dark furniture and small window did not add to the rooms appearance. Having said this we enjoyed our time here but if we ever return to Toronto will try somewhere else."

They were all wonderful - we particularly enjoyed speaking with Janita Walton. We would definitely stay there again.",

Every employee greeted us nicely, not a negative person in the place! 4. 160 a night more than I'm used to but had a free night coupon so helped 5. Breakfast included to get the day going 6. I would stay here again, we had a great time!",

The room was so clean and comfortable. The complementary breackfast buffet is really good. The employees have excelent knowledge of the nearby good restaurants. It was a pleasant stay.",

Breakfast is served from 6-10AM. The breakfast bar is very popular with families. If you plan to eat after 8AM be prepared to deal with a swarm of children.",

They provided free breakfast, and free coffee and tea 24 hours a day. The location is very convenient and a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave. The rooms need a little remodeling, though, but are clean and comfortable.",

My wife is in a wheel chair and the room was fully accessible, the bath is even wider in the middle so you can turn round in the shower. All the staff were very friendly and the doors were always opened for us before we got there, even when it was snowing like mad - Thanks everyone. You must visit the Rock Bottom Brewery just around the corner - the burgers are great and huge, the main courses are elegant and sophisticated and the carrot cake is big enough to use as a building brick - but a lot tastier!! BUT the main attraction is the great beers available all local brews and tasting great. Again would recommend this hotel to everyone, they were still filling up the breakfast racks with 5 minutes to go (Finish -10 am weekdays, 11 am weekends), and fresh coffee is always available in the breakfast room."

                "We enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt - had a nice room (paid for an upgraded water view, which was nice to have), the staff was friendly and helpful, the location is perfect and we had a very decent rate. The lobbies were pretty nice, but we didn't hang out there or eat at any of the places. We walked most places (or took a cab if our destination was really far), even in the middle of winter. I try not to be too picky about these things, but our room was dusty the whole time we were there. It was enough to be noticed, so it should have been cleaned by the staff. Also, we weren't very fond of the bed. It was a bit on the hard side and wasn't exactly plus. It wasn't horrible though. Again, not horrible, but our room was very hot no matter how we set the temp at.",
                "The Hyatt is recently remodeled and very nice. The staff was extremely friendly and always helpful. The location is centrally located on the mag mile and we could easily walk to all there was to do downtown. Will definitely stay here again. Classy but not stuffy.",
                "I stayed two nights on business. The location was great and the room was very nice. The price was $25-$30 cheaper than any comparable hotels in the area. I had two minor complaints. The closet door was off the track, and wouldn't open when I checked in, and they didn't fix it the second day. Also, the Big Bar closed early, and the bartender was not very polite about letting me know before last call. Other than that, I would highly recommend the place.",
                "We loved our stay at the Hyatt Regency. I really don't think there is a better location in downtown. So conveniently located off the river and a short jaunt to Michigan Ave, Grant Park, and Navy Pier. I have already recommended this hotel to other travelers heading to Chicago. I would say, however, the dining in the hotel is pretty pricey. So, if you are looking to save a few bucks get outside of the four walls of the hotel. That being said, I will still always stay at this hotel when traveling to Chicago, with out a doubt.",
                "Overall the hotel is ok, very busy and noisy. Valet parking is the only choice you have and an additional $50 for every 24 hours. Valet parking stole our Ipod so they told us to fill out a claims report which we did and then we had to wait more than a week to call the claims department because the one and only person they have working claims was on vacation. Once I was able to talk to the claims department she was no help at all. She basically called me a liar and we will not be getting reimbursed for the loss of our IPod. I am furious that it cost me $50 per day extra and then we will have to pay another $250 + to replace our IPod.",
                "I stayed here for two nights to partake in the Chicago St. Patricks festivities. Check in went super fast, and we were given a room the was so newly remodeled you could still catch a whiff of the fresh paint. It overlooked the river, which made for some great shots when they dyed it! Also, they allowed us a late check out of 2pm, at no charge, in order to not miss the parade. The beds were amazing, as was the bathroom. Plenty of space, with a very nice desk set up. And being one block from Michigan, and a 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, this is a great location. Couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel.",
                "As a hotel, it's very nice, with very nice amenitiies, but it's also expensive. Canned soft drink in the mini-bar cost $4.25, and Internet use in the business center was something like $10 for 7 minutes (or was that $7 for 10 minutes?). Location is good. If price is no object, it's a good choice, but there are better bargains in the area.",
                "Stayed there Feb 2005. A former jewel that has fallen into disrepair. The hotel is dark, and shabby. Even the newer wing is not up to par. If you stay in the Loop area, try the Burham instead."

                "I stayed at this hotel while traveling on business and it was by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. The second I walked in the room, I knew that I wasn't going to want to leave and ordered myself some room service. It has a very classic style with every modern convenience you could hope for. The bed is very comfortable and the fireplace makes it very cozy. It wasn't cold enough for me to really use the fireplace but I did anyway and cranked up the AC. The shower was also fantastic. I immediately declared that I needed to get myself a rainshower as soon as I was able! It is a pricey hotel but definitely worth it if you can swing it!",
                "as local residents and first time guests, we found this hotel exceeded our expectations. staff were nothing but attentive and hospitable. our room was upgraded upon arrival; we couldn't have asked for more. this is a lovely hotel with not only luxurious amenities but superb staff. we can't wait to return!",
                "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Labor Day weekend, the same number of nights as we stayed in October 2007. An elegant, small hotel! The front desk and room service staffs, the concierges, restaurant and in-room breakfasts, and the chauffeured car service were all excellent. Our room (#407) was very elegant and quiet, was on the west side of the building, and had windows on 2 walls. Our only problem was that the sink taps were very tight.",
                "My boyfriend has stayed here several times for business trips but this was our first leisure visit--service remains impeccable. Still received his personalized business cards and professional attentive service. Rooftop is a nice touch on a warn day to share a bottle of wine. Hotel car service was a great perk as well and we used it every night to go to our dinners around town. I am a huge product snob--the Lemon Sugar line from Fresh that they provide in the rooms has made me a regular user. And the location is perfect--within walking distance to everywhere. When it's colder out, we will return and use the fireplace in our beautiful room.",
                "My wife and I stayed at the XV Beacon recently and from the minute we got out of our car (valet right at the entrance) to the minute we left the service/staff was exceptional. The rooms were beautiful and very clean and much larger than we expected from a historical building. There wasn't anything that had been left out, from the stereo playing when we entered the room to the weather report for the next day sitting on the night stand! The hotel is located right in the heart of Boston next to the Common and a few minutes walk to the waterfront, the possibilities are endless for restaurants and night life. We would definitely go back to this hotel, combined with the location we had a great experience!",
                "We were on a business/leisure trip. It was a high star rating and deserved it. Around the corner from Boston Common, Fanueiul Hall, etc. Easy to get to city centre. The hotel breakfast was fantastic, if expensive. Every dish was amazing. When in Boston city, the Mapparium is worth a visit, along with the top of the Prudential building, to get a great idea of where everything is. There are some great museums to visit.",
                "Favourite hotel in Boston. Modern luxury without seeming formulaic. Good for indulgent weekends in town.",
                "I stayed a few weeks ago at this hotel and I heard everything! The walls are thin as paper as i heard every conversation from the room next door. I apprectiate that some builings in boston are older, but if you own a hotel you must do something ot soudnproof it!!!!"

                "Great location and greater service at this Hyatt in Boston. No more convient place to stay. Came in by train and never needed to have a car. You are right in the middle of everything! The hotel & service is top notch and this isn't my first stay in Boston!",
                "When we booked this hotel we were worried because we saw more negative reviews than good at that time. I have no complainst...the staff was very helpful, the in house restaurant was excellent, the rooms were very clean. Very close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and Marshall's. . .walking distance to all other sites that we wanted to see. . . The only thing I can say negatively is paying for WIFI but that is a problem with all hotels.",
                "Disappointing when hotels such as this still charge for wifi access. We didn't get notified verbally about the complimentary breakfast either although it was no doubt in the fine print somewhere. Rooms were nice and clean although a little boring and the bed not that comfortable. Can't fault the location, it was very easy to get anywhere with the subway station a few hundred metres away.",
                "We stayed here for business. It was in a great location, close to the theater district, shopping, etc. There is only one restaurant and a very small bar in the hotel. It would have been nice to have additional options. There were restaurants close by, but again, it would have been nice to have had the convenience of additional dining places. The fitness center was so so. I was very disappointed that there was a charge for internet. When paying the price we paid per night, that should have been included in the room cost. Great concierges.",
                "hi, i have read all the reviews and they are a bit mixed.We have just stayed there n i have to say it 's great.Its a central location - we hired a car and left it back 4 days early as parking is so expensive-unless u have to dont hire a car-otherwise park it in the place out in front of the hotel its the cheapest we checked them all i have the sore feet to prove it!",
                "I stay at this hotel very frequently, and every single time, my experience has been fabulous. The hotel is right in the downtown area and 5 min. walk from South Station which really helps me as I frequently take the train from/to New York. The rooms are really nice, bathrooms and linen really clean and above all else, the staff is some of the most friendly I have ever come across, rifht from the front desk to the concierge and housekeeping. Samir Boukhari, the front desk manager is delightfully courteous and has always gone out of his way to help and make my stay very comfortable every single time. Dianna, Aruna and Lexi at the front desk and Anthony with the concierge are wonderful as ever. I would stay here as long as business/pleasure keeps taking me into Boston.",
                "We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Boston for one night during Memorial Day weekend. The staff was great, we were upgraded to a Terrace Suite when we checked in. It was beautiful and very clean/pleasant, although you can't actually go out onto the Terrace so that was bittersweet. We ordered room service which was excellent! The breakfast buffet was wonderful as well! Great location to all of Boston. Overall a great trip! Will return to this hotel whenever we are in Boston.",
                "I traveled here for business for the first time and was somewhat disappointed. There is only wireless internet service in most of the rooms, which I can not use with my office laptop for security reasons. I had to switch rooms in order to have high speed internet access... and the internet service seemed to work only some of the time. The connection wasn't working consistently and nobody in the hotel could help. They offered a toll free number for the tech people at the DSL company. The front desk failed to provide me with my mini-bar key and the mirror in the bathroom had a huge crack in it... There were many many tourists in the hotel, which isn't good for business travelers because they tend to make a lot of noise. I don't think I'll travel here again unless I am a tourist."

It is a short walk away from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and a bit longer to la Sagrada Familia, the location couldn't be better! Within a couple of blocks it has many restaurants to chose from and can't forget to mention that it's in a great shopping area. From now on the place where we'll stay when visiting Barcelona.",
                "Second time in this hotel and kinda disappointed. Rooms are ok and it is a good value for money mainly due to the great location on Paseig de Gracia, but the service does not seem to care so much about their customers. They are physically present behind the desk, but it stops here. It seems that they are breathing boredom. If you go to Barcelona for a short weekend and do not plan to spend too much time at the hotel, it'll be alright. If not, i'm sure you can pick a better place where the service will show you a more positive and customer focused attitude.",
                "I have stayed here three times -all on business trips where the hotel was booked for me. In fact, there are many meetings held here, and so you might find yourself surrounded by a large group of businessmen - not necessarily a bad thing -but just be aware. The two lifts are small and infrequent, and so you may have to wait a long time - which is annoying if you are on the top floors. The location is great for seeing Barcelona -you can reach most of the central sights by foot -including the Gaudi cathedral. Very near to a metro line , which is also a bonus. Rooms are fine -just try to get one facing the courtyard at the back -the ones to the front can be noisy. Biggest disappointment was the breakfast -17€ for a very poor selection - definitely not worth it. I didn`t bother after the first morning.",

                "We got a really good deal on the rooms at this hotel and, therefore, it was worth what we paid for it. However, I would have been dissapointed if we had payed full price for this. We went in january which I know is not in season however, the terraces were closed and the pools were not open. They were also doing refurbishment works to one of the terraces, none of this was really communicated until you checked in. The room was a reasonable size as we had one at the end of a corridor and the bed was comfy. The bathrooms however, need some updating, they were tired and not in the best condition. Also be warned if you stay on the front of the hotel, the spanish like to beep their horns and this can be disturbing.",
                "Great hotel! i can only think of a few things wrong with our stay, for one, breakfast was not worth the price paid and room service was a bit overpriced as well, but with such a wide variety of other places to eat in barcelona, it didn{t really mattter much. The standard room was small but then again the bed was huge! and the location... it can't get eny better!!!!",

                "This hotel is situated at around 10 min by cab from the center (barrio gotico). Must be max 10 years old. Can be reached also by tram or metro. Rooms are clean, beds a bit hard. Bar is OK and the patio too but mostly in the shadom in the evening. Rooms that had a sea view don't have it anymore (see previous reviews). A bit expensive for the location and the lack of view (my room had a view on a skeleton building (crisis, what crisis?) on the side of the hotel, not charming at all). The pool on the 17th is not heated, so quite difficult to swim at this time of the year, nice view on the utility building on the other side and on the sea and beach, plus power plant for the rest.",
                "I stayed in the diagonal zero for 4 nights while attending a congress. The area near the hotel is not nice, however, the metro station is nearby and you can visit the centre in a few minutes The rooms are spacious, mattress is moderate, views are poor. The decoration is modern but on the poor side. Breakfast was ok, but i consider it unacceptable to drink disgusting coffee from a machine in a 4 star hotel...it shows lack of respect for the client. The Personnel was very polite. There is a very good gym in the hotel and free wifi which is very important.",
                "I stay for 3 nights in a business trip, the hotel is beautiful and the room was suburb. It’s far from the city town but have the beach nearby and a subway station pretty close. For sure I will come back again",
                "The rooms and prices looked good and the pool looked attractive online, however the reality was different. I booked a family room which is really 2 separate bedrooms next to each other behind another door for privacy which was meant to lock but didn't. My kids room smelt like someone had smoked 100 cigarettes in it and had drugs and booze on the table when we checked in. They cleaned but the smell didn't go away for all 3 days and they would not change the rooms. The pool is tiny and over crowded with hardly any beds to lie on which is quite difficult with kids in a very hot city. Well done for offering free WiFi but making people check into your Facebook page every time is very irritating. Overall it is good value but it is most suited to weekend getaways for young party couples or mates.",
                "We only stayed one night but had most of 2 days sightseeing in Barcelona with fairly grown up family in 2 bedrooms. Hotel happy to look after our luggage. Perhaps in an area a bit far from the character of Barcelona, but very convenient for tram and subway. Also large shopping centre close by with lots of dining choice. Pool a bit crowded as our trip was in the heat of August and slightly disappointing that they charged for towel use. Very helpful porter showed us control panel for lights/aircon etc - all very hi-tech.",

The beach is with 10 mins walking distance from the hotel and 5 mins walk from a great shopping mall Diagonal Mar where there are lots of great restaurants. The metro is a 2 min walk and a 10 min journey or 6 stops to the centre of the city with no changes. We loved it!"

                "Visited the Gaylord Palms this past weekend and was definitely impressed. Rooms extremely clean, staff very helpful, check-in was speedy, and activities to keep my son occupied for awhile. I definitely will be visiting again. Beautiful hotel, great staff and great location.",
                "Our 1 bedroom suite was spectacular! Large bedroom and living room each with flat screen in HD. Wifi throughout the facility. Very clean resort. Beautiful atriums with fish, alligators etc. Daily feedings with question and answer periods. Many restaurants and bars located within. Only minutes from Disney. Golf nearby at Celebration with preferred rates when booked through the concierge. Nothing bad to say at all",
                "The Shrek the Halls display was very cool (no pun intended). It's quite chilly, but very neat to see all the figures made of ice. The ICE attraction with the snow was very simple. Young children that have never seen snow would appreciate it,but that's about it. Our 9 year old was very bored. Thought the prices were quite expensive. Plus it's $13 to park...ugh!",
                "Brought my mother to celebrate her b-day. Both restaurants where we dined were very good - cannot say enough great things about Old Hickory. The steak was one of the best I've had. The massage was terrific and you must wear their most comfortable robe back to your room. Highly recommend this hotel and would definitley stay there again.",
                "Most rooms overlook an interior, glass covered courtyard which reminded me of the habitats you see at the zoo. If you are the spouse of a convention goer, you are trapped there. There is nothing to do but sit at the pool or work out if you don't want to go to Disney World. Even the chairs and benches are uncomfortable and designed to make you move on. I longed to find a window and look out at the real world.",
                "I was lucky enough to be able to accompany my husband on a business trip to the Gaylord Palms Resort. We were thrilled from beginning to end. We pulled up to the magnificent resort and were delighted at the front desk with warm welcomes and friendly personalities from all. The front desk engaged us both in conversation and gave many tips on how I could enjoy the resort while my husband was working. Our room in the Emeral Bay section of the hotel was very clean and whenever we needed anything (toiletries, turn down service, directions) we dialed #88 on our room phone and were connected to friendly staff with all the answers! I explored resturants, the spa, and the pools and truly enjoyed my relaxing few days at this resort. I recommended this hotel to couples, families, business travelers, and soloists.",
                "We loved the hotel and the grounds. We got an incredible deal on hotwire, so we couldn't beat the value. The service was excellent. We were traveling with two small children and they were very accomodating. The only complaint was that the food was very expensive. We were not traveling on an expense account and we had failed to rent a car, so our dining options were limited to the Resort. A simple continental breakfast cost us over $8--too much to spend on a bowl of cereal and a banana for a two year old. The restaurants were very expensive and we wound up ordering in pizza one night. But if you're on an expense account or have a car to get to the store (each room has a refrigerator) or to other dining options, this is a fantastic place to stay.",
                "I have stayed at the gaylord Palms for the past couple of years for a yearly convention . I love this place and the friendly service we receive while there . I'm sure the prices are higher than other hotels , but I feel we get what we pay for . I do think the boat could be a little better as far as the food they serve . etc... . I look forward to this as a weekend spot every year for my convention and while I am only an hour away after the weekend we feel like we have had a mini vacation . I wouldn't change one thing about my stay except that I would love to be able to stay a week . I look forward to this years convention and the fun times my kids will have"

                "The \"Hotel\" is actually like something straight out of My Name is Earl. Filthy carpets, bugs in the refridgerator and all over the room. Horrendously misrepresented by the pictures on the website, the bbq area and lagoon are disgraceful. I paid for 2 star Quality, but would never stay here, recommend it, etc. In fairness the staff are very friendly and all issues raised were dealt with, they seem to know with the quality of their resort, they HAVE to provide good service. Bar is very reasonable, with Long Island Iced tea recommended. My honest advice, not even worth the small amount paid, I will never stay here again, you have been warned!!!",
                "This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and both times have been totally trouble free. We stayed for 10 nights and had no problems. The room was clean and was cleaned every day, towels and bed sheets changed we came back every day to a spotless room. We only seen reception staff to check in and out but they seemed friendly enough and there were no additional charges over what we paid when we booked. The location is exellent, took about 10 mins to get to disney and about 20 mins to Universal and Seaworld. Aircon and tv worked well and there was always a parking space outside our room despite the hotel being quite busy over spring break. I will definatly stay here again if back in Orlando :)",
                "This is one of my favorite hotels in Kissimmee. It is a Instead super comfortable, accessible parks and disney all the best places you can eat in your vacation. The attention is very satisfactory. I have two Sometimes visiting this hotel and will not be the last. since its price and the comfort of your rooms make your stay a very welcoming.",
                "We stay here every year. I like the hotel, its clean, the employees are very nice and the prices are great. I will continue to stay here!",
                "Is a nice hotel with many amenities, room service was excellent. The shuttle was not so confy, because run for 3 hotels, but Champions is the first so you can have a seat haha. If you have a car, fine, because if you don't have a car you don't have many alternatives to eat. I like this hotel and really recomend it. This hotel is near to a Chinese buffett, Dominos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Walgreens, McDonalds...",
                "I had a lovey stay. The resort is a value, and taking the back road on Sherberth, I traveled to Disney in 6 minutes. The staff is warm and attentive. I felt like I was at home with family.",
                "We were originally due to stay for 10 nights and we booked for three people - my teenager daughter and her friend and myself. On arrival in the room the beds were very small double beds and only two of them - I spoke to the manager who said that all the rooms were exactly the same (untrue) and that for an extra $10 we could have a rollaway bed. The rooms are far too small for more than two people. The site is not well maintained and the pool not clean. We were then stranded due to the volcano and having enquired about staying for an additional five nights was told that we could have a special price of $39 per night - only to find out on the website for the hotel that the cost for that period of time would be $32 per night. Scammed!!! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone - there are far better places to stay which are closer to the amenities.",
                "Champions World Resort was exactly what we were looking for. A brief relaxing weekend near Orlando Fl. The rooms were nice and clean, and the hotel staff was very responsive and attentive to our needs. I highly recommend this resort."
